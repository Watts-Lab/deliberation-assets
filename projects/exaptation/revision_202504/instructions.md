# 🎯 Your Task: Describe & Guess Images

You’ll be paired with another participant for a short interactive game. You’ll take turns playing two roles:

### 🗣️ The Describer

- You will see one image and describe it out loud to your partner.
- Your goal is to describe it clearly and specifically so they can pick the matching image from a panel of 8.

### 🧠 The Guesser

- You will see a panel of 8 numbered images (1–8).
- Your partner will describe one of those images.
- Your job is to figure out which image they’re describing and select the correct number.

# 🔁 The Game Flow

- First, one of you describes 8 images while the other guesses.
- Then, you switch roles.
- You’ll repeat this so that each of you plays both roles twice.
- That means you’ll describe 16 different images, and guess on two different image panels.

# 🧪 Practice

This is an example image that could be shown to the describer:
