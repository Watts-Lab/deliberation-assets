THis revision put all the stumulus/response items in a single video call round, having one player describe images, and the other player guess.
This made it so that players couldn't "screen shot" the images, but also made it so that they could just go back and forth for more info
This meant that they weren't forced to find a schema they could remember, and so didn't "condense".

Turns out, planning for coordinated efforts in the future is different from coordinating in real time!
