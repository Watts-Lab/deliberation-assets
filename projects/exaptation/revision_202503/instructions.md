# The game you are about to play has two stages:

## Stage 1: Discussion and labeling (Video Call) ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤

Your group will see a set of eight images, like the ones blurred out below.

Come up with **unique** labels for each image, and enter them in a shared text box.

![labeling_demo](projects/exaptation/revision_202503/instructions_demo_labeling.jpg)

You will need to remember each label exactly, so make your labels short, memorable, and _distinct_ from one another.

You will have a maximum of 10 minutes in the first round, 5 minutes in the second round, 1 minute in the third round, and will not be able to talk in the fourth round.

## Stage 2: Recall (On your own) ðŸ‘¤

After your discussion, we will show you images one at a time, and ask you to type the label your group decided on for that image.

![recall_demo](projects/exaptation/revision_202503/instructions_demo_recall.jpg)

- If everyone's enters the correct label for the image, you earn 10 points.
- If anyone enters the wrong label, nobody earns any points.

### You will play four rounds of labeling and recall, with different images in each round.
