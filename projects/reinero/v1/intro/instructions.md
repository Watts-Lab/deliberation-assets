# About this study

In this study, you will be asked to read a story written and posted by **an actual person** on the internet and make a judgment about them.

We are curious about your moral intuitions -- whether you think the person was **in the right or the wrong**. We are simply interested in what you think.

Afterward, you will have a brief conversation with another participant via video call.

Note: After these intro steps, you will enter a waiting room to be matched with another participant for your conversation. It may take a few minutes to find a match, so please wait for other participants to arrive. If you wait more than 10 minutes, you will have the option to leave and be paid a screening payment.
