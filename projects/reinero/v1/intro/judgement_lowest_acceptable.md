## Wiggle room?

Sometimes people make a moral judgment, just as you did above, but they also have some wiggle room around that judgment.

For example, imagine you put your moral judgment at 50. You might think it was also acceptable for someone to give a rating as low as 40, or a rating as high as 60. But perhaps you draw that line thereafter and think that anyone who said it was below 40 or above 60 was making a judgment that you find unacceptable.

### What is the **LOWEST** rating that someone else might give, that you would find acceptable?
