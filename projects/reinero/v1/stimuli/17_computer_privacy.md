"Am I The Asshole for not giving my 17 year old any privacy or autonomy with the computer because he's consistently demonstrated he can't be trusted to use it responsibly?

I don't think I am, I think I'm being a good parent. I'm a father of 2 kids. My older daughter is in college and lives with us still. My younger one however is the rebellious and problem child that loves to wrangle out of my control.

At around 11 or so we found he discovered the dark side of the internet, and since then we've put parental controls and time restrictions on the computer. the doctor recommended limiting screen time and exposure because it could have negative health effects. (This is a doctor with an M.D., his advice outweighs anything my son has to say.)

This worked well for a while, but then multiple times he found a way around the filters and kept violating our rules of usage, and used the computer at night. Every time we took it away for a week and tightened the controls and there was a password. Everything went well for some time, until I checked the browsing history and found that he had violated the rules again, and was now going on troll and skeptic/atheist forums that perpetuate misinformation and aren't good for him.

This was also the time where he got his first gaming computer that I got from my coworker's son who moved away to college, so before giving this to him, we made sure that he couldn't bypass our restrictions. We put Windows controls on it that can't be bypassed. He also must fill out a form that logs his hours and what sites he goes on, because now there is a zero tolerance policy. He must report everything he does to us, because he's consistently shown he can't be trusted with any semblance of privacy or autonomy, so now I've imposed a policy similar to my work; everything must be transparent to the authority of the establishment, and if there's any pushback or resistance, there will be consequences. His computer is now out in the open so there's peer pressure to stay obedient. And he's limited to 2 hours a day and has to be off before 6pm so the blue light and radiation don't affect his sleep.

Around this time my son was 16 going on 17, and started to express discontent over our “draconian” rules and being monitored and controlled so much, because the controls often filter sites that are totally safe and locks him out in the middle of games, and when we're away he can't get the password to allow more time. I said that as long as he lives here then he will abide by the rules, and this inconvenience and restriction will teach him not to be so rebellious and deceitful. Plus I'm paying for the internet and electricity, he has no right to complain. And time extensions will not be honored unless it's for homework, but if he wants to learn skills on Khan Academy, he's out of luck, use the time he has instead of playing games. There are people in China who are much less fortunate and more censored than him. Even if he pays for his own tech, it will still be locked down, because until he's 18 he doesn't own anything.

Recently this has left me asking if I'm the asshole. I don't think I am, since everyone else I know agrees with the rules."
