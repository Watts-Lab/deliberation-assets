# "Am I The Asshole for not making my son wear a suit?

We have 4 kids (ages 7, 5.5, 2 and 11 months). Our older 3 are boys and the youngest is a girl. Since our 5.5 year old was born, we've decided to keep clothes and toys pretty gender-neutral. It's not a big deal to any of us, and all we do is not force our kids to wear one type of clothing or another, or get a toy that's aimed toward a certain gender. That being said, our 11 month old is obviously too young to choose her own clothes, but she wears a lot of her older brothers' handmedowns. My 5.5 year old really gravitates towards pink and purple and typically girl clothes. 2 year old likes whatever his older brother does, etc.

Here's the issue. My husband's closest friend is getting married this May. He's godfather to our oldest and has known us for decades. He asked if our two oldest would be the ringbearers. He was then talking about how his fiancee still hadn't picked a flower girl, because all the girls in their family are too young or too old. I joked that our 5 yo could do it, and he said that's a great idea. He ran the idea past his fiancee, and she said that'd be great. This weekend, we were having suits and dresses altered, and flowerboy wants a dress. None of us were surprised, the kid loves dresses. We explained that daddy and daddy's best friend would be wearing suits too. He still didn't want it. He wanted a dress.

Husband's best friend said he didn't care what our son wore, but he'd ask his fiancee. She said, loudly, "I knew they were going to dress their kids weird just to make a scene." Then her mom proceeded to say how distracting a flowerboy in a dress would be, and it's inappropriate of us to even ask and try and push our agenda. That made my blood boil, so I grabbed the kids, put them in the car, and waited for my husband. I would never make any of my kids wear something they don't want to, and I feel like if it was a girl in a suit, it'd be considered cute.

Husband's best friend has been talking to us and apologizing, but I'm close to saying none of us are going to be in the wedding if 5 yo can't be due to something stupid like clothes. It would be really upsetting, because the groom has been our rock through everything and even now he's so understanding. But the snide comments his fiancee made and refusing to let my boy wear what he wants, despite it being formal, is really hurting. I'm absolutely not going to be in the wedding if my son isn't and my husband is his best man. I wanted to be a united front with my entire family, but having my son be ringbearer and husband being best man without my other son is just upsetting. Am I the asshole?"
