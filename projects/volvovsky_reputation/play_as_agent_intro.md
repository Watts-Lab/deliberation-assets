## Training round 2: Play as Agent

In this phase, you are playing as the **agent** in the art game.

_This is a training round, so the buyer will be played by a bot:_

A potential buyer has paid you **50 points** to hire you to purchase a piece of art, in addition to the money to buy the art. They have described the piece of art they want in a text message.

Unfortunately, you left your phone at home, with their description of the art piece. The gallery is going to close soon, so the only way you can get your phone in time is to pay **30 points** for a taxi home and back.

Alternatively, you can keep those 30 points, and buy whichever art piece you guess the buyer wants.

Just know, this is a prolific buyer who buys many pieces of art, and may want to hire you again in the future. If you get the wrong piece of art, the buyer might not want to hire you again.

Are you going to **pay 30 points** to take a taxi home to get your phone?

_As this is a training round, select "Yes"_
