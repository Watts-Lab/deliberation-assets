## Training round 2: Play as Agent

In this phase, you are playing as the **agent** in the Art Buying Game.

_This is a training round, so the collector will be played by a bot:_

A potential collector has paid you **50 points** to purchase a piece of art, and has given you the money to buy it.

They described the piece they want in a text message, but unfortunately you left your phone at home, so you can't read the message.

The gallery closes soon, and the only way you can read the message in time is to **pay 30 points** for a taxi home and back.

Or, you can keep those 30 points, and buy whichever art piece you guess the collector wants.

ðŸ‘‰ If you get the right piece, this collector may want to hire you again in the future.

**Are you going to pay 30 points to take a taxi home to get your phone?**

_As this is a training round, select "Yes"_
