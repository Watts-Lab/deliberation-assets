## Training round 2:

In this phase, you are playing as the **agent** in the art game:

A potential buyer has paid you **50 points** hired you to purchase a piece of art and described the piece of art in their message.

Unfortunately, you left your phone at home, with their description of the art piece. The gallery is going to close soon, so the only way you can get your phone in time is to pay **30 points** for a taxi home and back.

Alternatively, you can keep those 30 points, and buy which art piece you guess the buyer wants.

Just know, this is a prolific buyer who buys many pieces of art, and may want to hire you again in the future. If you get the wrong piece of art, the buyer might not want to hire you again.

Are you going to take a taxi home to get your phone?
