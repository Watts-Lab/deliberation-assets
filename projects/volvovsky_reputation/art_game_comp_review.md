## Review Art Game Instructions

_The **buyer** decides whether to pay **50 points** to hire an **agent** to purchase a piece of art, or to end the game._

_If the buyer hires the agent, they send them a text message with a description of the piece._

_When the agent arrives at the gallery, they realize they left their phone (with the buyer's message) at home. They may either:_

- _Spend **30 points** to take a cab home, retrieve the phone, and return to the gallery before it closes_
- _Buy a piece of art without seeing the message_

_The buyer pays the agent regardless of what the agent decides to do._

_If the agent purchases the correct piece, the buyer earns **80 points**._

_If the agent buys the wrong piece, the buyer earns nothing, and loses the **50 points** they paid the agent._

_At the end of the round, the buyer may choose to hire the same agent to buy another piece of art, or end the game._

ðŸ‘‰ _The buyer doesn't know that the agent forgot their phone, only whether they purchased the correct piece of art._
