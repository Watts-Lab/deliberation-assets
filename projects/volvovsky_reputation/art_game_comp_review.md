# Excellent, you have completed training!

_Before we begin, we want to check that you got everything._

## Review Art Game Instructions

- The **buyer** decides whether to pay **50 points** to hire an **agent** to purchase a piece of art.
- If the buyer hires the agent:

  1. The buyer is shown which piece of art to buy.
  2. The buyer sends a message to the agent, specifying which piece to purchase.

- When the agent arrives at the gallery, they realize they left their phone (with the buyer's message) at home. The agent now faces two choices:

  1. Spend **30 points** to take a cab home, retrieve the phone, and return to the gallery before it closes.
  2. Buy a piece of art **blind** (without the message).

- If the agent purchases the correct piece, the buyer earns **80 points**. If the agent buys the wrong piece, the buyer gets no additional points, and loses the **50 points** they paid the agent.

- At the end of the round, the buyer can hire the same agent to buy another piece of art.

#### Important Notes:

- If the buyer refuses to hire the agent, the game ends.
- The buyer cannot see whether the agent took a cab home to retrieve the message, only whether the agent purchased the correct piece of art.
