## Training round 1: Play as **Collector**

In this training round you play as the wealthy art collector, and the agent will be played by this cute little robot:

## You want to buy this piece of art from a gallery in New York:

Unfortunately, you can't travel to the gallery. You can either:

- choose not to buy the art and get **0 points**, or
- pay an agent **50 points** from your current earnings to purchase the art for you. If the agent buys the right piece, you get **80 points**. Otherwise, you get nothing, and lose the points you paid the agent.

Earning 100 points is worth $2.00

ðŸ‘‰ _If you hire the agent, you can hire them again to purchase other pieces. If you don't, the Art Buying Game will end._

**Would you like to hire the agent to purchase this art for you?**

_As this is a training round, select "Yes"_
