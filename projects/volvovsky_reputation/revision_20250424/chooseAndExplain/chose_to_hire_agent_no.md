## Training round 2:

You want to buy this piece of art on display at a gallery in New York:

![purchase image](projects/volvovsky_reputation/Tangram_A6.jpg)

Since you can't travel to the gallery, you need to decide whether to pay an agent **50 points** from your current earnings to purchase the art for you or to forgo the opportunity.

_This is a training round, so the agent will be played by a bot:_

If the agent buys the correct art piece, you will get **80 points**. Otherwise, you get nothing.

If you hire the agent, you will likely be able to hire them again to purchase other pieces. If you decide not to hire them, you won't get another chance to buy this piece of art, or to work with this agent in the future.

Would you like to hire the agent to purchase this art for you?

_Please select "No" to end the training_
