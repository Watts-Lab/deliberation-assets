# About the study

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for participating in our study! ðŸŽ‰

Before you go, we wanted to tell you what our study was about.

We wanted to see whether building a relationship with someone during the Labeling Game, and playing again with that person during the Art Buying Game (if you were in that condition) changed how you felt about the Agent.

We wanted to keep the Agentâ€™s behavior consistent, and we also didnâ€™t want you to wait too long while the collector and Agent make their decisions. So instead of showing you a live game, **we showed you a simulated game** based on live games we recorded in the past.
