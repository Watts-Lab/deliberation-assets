note: we choose to tell the observer that there are 5 rounds because we don't believe they will think about end-game effects with a known number of rounds. Its too game theoretic to think about as an observer. (they might think about it if they were actually playing, but this is simpler.)

# Observe a game

Because we have an odd number of players, we are running the Art Buying Game as a "Round Robin" style, so someone else will play with the `Green Elephant` before you.

You will watch the `Green Elephant` with another participant, either from your team, or another team.

After you observe their game, you may update your bid, so pay attention, in case you decide to change your bid.

You will observe **up to 5 rounds** of the game, if the collector chooses to hire the `Green Elephant` for each round.

You will get 100 points for observing the game.
