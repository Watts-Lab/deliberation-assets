note: we choose to tell the observer that there are 5 rounds because we don't believe they will think about end-game effects with a known number of rounds. Its too game theoretic to think about as an observer. (they might think about it if they were actually playing, but this is simpler.)

# Unfortunately we couldn't match you in the first game.

Don't worry, this actually gives you an advantage: you get to observe a game between one agent and one buyer, before deciding to hire the agent yourself.

The buyer and agent will play **up to 5 rounds** of the game, if the buyer chooses to hire the agent for each round.

Then you will have the chance to switch places with the buyer if you want to.
