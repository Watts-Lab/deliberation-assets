# Unfortunately we couldn't match you in the first game.

Don't worry, this actually gives you an advantage: you get to observe an agent before deciding to hire them if you wish.

Remember:

- If the buyer hires an agent who buys the right art, they will earn 30 points per piece (after accounting for the agent's wages).
- If the agent buys the wrong art, the buyer will lose the 50 points paid to the agent, and will earn nothing.
- The agent gets 50 points when they are hired, but may decide to spend 30 points to get their phone.
