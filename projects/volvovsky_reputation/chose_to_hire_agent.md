## You have finished the Labeling Game. ðŸ¥³

Now we would like you to play another game we call the Art Buying game.
We will run you through some training rounds before the game starts.

## Training round 1:

You want to buy this piece of art on display at a gallery in New York:

![purchase image](projects/volvovsky_reputation/Tangram_A5.jpg)

Since you can't travel to the gallery, you need to decide whether to pay an agent **50 points** to purchase the art for you or to forgo the opportunity.

_This is a training round, so the agent will be played by a bot:_

If the agent buys the correct art piece, you will get **80 points**. Otherwise, you get nothing.

If you hire the agent, you will likely be able to hire them again to purchase other pieces. However, if you decide not to hire them, you won't get another chance to buy this piece of art, or to work with this agent in the future.

Would you like to hire the agent to purchase this art for you?

_As this is a training round, select "Yes"_
