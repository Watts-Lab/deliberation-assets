# Game 2: Art Buying Game

This game has two roles: **Buyer** and **Agent**.

Before we begin, you will play a training round to learn each role.

## Training round 1: Play as **Buyer**

You want to buy this piece of art from a gallery in New York:

Unfortunately, you can't travel to the gallery. You can either:

- choose not to buy the art and get **0 points**, or
- pay an agent **50 points** to purchase the art for you. If the agent buys the right piece, you get **80 points**. Otherwise, you get nothing.

ðŸ‘‰ _If you hire the agent, you can hire them again to purchase other pieces. If you don't, the Art Buying Game will end._

In this training round, the agent will be played by a bot:
