# Game 1: Labeling Game

As a group, come up with labels for each of these images, and enter them in the shared text box below.

Names should be:

- easy to remember
- less than 15 characters long
- unique to each image

We will quiz you on the names you chose in the next stage of the experiment. You'll get more points the more accurately you recall your labels.
