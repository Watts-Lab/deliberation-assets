# Game 1: Labeling Game

As a group, come up with labels for each of these images, and enter them in the shared text box below.

Names should be:

- easy to remember
- less than 15 characters long
- unique to each image

In the next stage, we will quiz you on the names you chose.

You will earn points only if **everyone** in your group remembers the correct name.
