We would like you to share your thoughts and opinions with the other person with an opposite view.

You have been selected to enter the interaction with a specific goal to keep in mind as you discuss.

Because your interaction partner holds a different view than you, we ask that you attempt to **persuade them to change their view on the topic so it is more aligned with your own view**. You should approach this discussion as an opportunity to get someone else to see the issue the way you do. You can use any strategy you would like during the interaction, as long as it is with the intention of bringing the other person closer to your view on the issue.

In the space below, we would like you to write about **why it may be useful to persuade others**. What benefits can you see that might result from successfully persuading another person?

Your answers can be about the upcoming conversation specifically, or about your interactions more generally.
