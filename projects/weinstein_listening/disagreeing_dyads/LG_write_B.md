We'd like you to enter the conversation with the goal to **learn about your partner's views**.

**Please take at least two minutes to think about your view on this topic as well as the things you could do to learn about your partnerâ€™s views.** The computer will let you know when that time has passed by allowing you to go to the next page, but you may take as much time as you need to gather your thoughts before proceeding.

Using the space below, please write a few notes of strategies you could use to **learn** about your partnerâ€™s views on the topic. These notes are to help you prepare for the conversation, so do not worry about grammar or spelling.
