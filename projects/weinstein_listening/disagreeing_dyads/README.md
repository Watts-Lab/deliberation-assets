# Setup todos:

- [ ] assign to dyads just in the order that they arrive
- [ ] assign to topics based on the max disagreement
- [ ] have a fallback condition based on time in lobby? Need to trigger dispatch again?
- [ ] in the pre-discussion optional surveys, make a note above the continue button saying "please answer all questions" (mostly for the first set of questions)
