## INFORMATION SHEET

### What is the research about?

This research is being done to understand the factors that influence people’s experiences during and responses to conversations involving disagreement. You won’t be told the full purpose of today’s study until the end of the study.

### What is involved in this study?

We expect that you will be in this research study for approximately 30 minutes. You may be asked to have a conversation with another participant about a topic on which you disagree and to report your experiences during the conversation and your views of the topic of disagreement. You may also be asked to reflect back on a past conversation. This conversation will be audio and video recorded.

### Are there any risks of doing this?

There is not much risk involved and there are safeguarding processes in place for the breakout sessions for conversations. However, if you experience any distress during the conversations, we are happy for you to pause or stop and leave the breakout room. You may also skip questions on the surveys, or withdraw early if you wish, without providing an explanation.

### Who has organised and approved the research?

The research is a collaboration between Buffalo University in the US and Prof. Netta Weinstein at the University of Reading. It is funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation. The research has been reviewed by The School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences Research Ethics Committee at the University of Reading and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct.

### How will my responses be handled?

Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your responses, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We will ask you for your name so we can assign credit and on the consent document. Your name will not be linked to your responses, nor will it be distributed. Videos of the conversation will be stored for 3 years on a secure drive managed by University of Reading, which only current members of our research team have access to. Data from this study may be shared in a publicly available resource, such as the open science framework (osf.io), but if this is done, no responses that could be used to identify you individually would be included. That is, de-identified study responses may be shared and could be used for future research studies or including by other researchers without additional consent.
