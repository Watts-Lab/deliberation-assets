We would like you to share your thoughts and opinions with the other person with an opposite view.

You have been selected to enter the interaction with a specific goal to keep in mind as you discuss.

Because your interaction partner holds a different view from your own, we ask that you attempt to **learn about their perspective on the issue**. You should approach this discussion as an opportunity to better understand how someone with a different view sees the issue. You can use any strategy you would like during the interaction, as long as it is with the intention of learning about the other personâ€™s view on the issue.
