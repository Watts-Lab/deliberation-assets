As you text your conversation partner, please do your best to try to **EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS** to them.

They may even disagree with you about the topic, but whether or not you disagree please make a great effort to demonstrate you have meaningful views that you can share, you have a useful perspective, and you value your views.

As a reminder, you can insert emojis using your computerâ€™s built-in keyboard shortcuts or emoji panel during the conversation.

For example:

- On Windows: Windows + . (period)
- On Mac: Command + Control + Space
