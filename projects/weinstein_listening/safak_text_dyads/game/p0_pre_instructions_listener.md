Soon, you will be asked to have a text-based conversation with another participant in the study about the topic that **YOUR PARTNER WILL INTRODUCE**.

As you text your conversation partner, please do your best to try to **SHOW YOUR PARTNER THAT YOU ARE REALLY LISTENING** to them.

They may even disagree with you about the topic, but whether or not you disagree please make a great effort to demonstrate you are hearing what they are saying, understanding their perspective, and value their views.
