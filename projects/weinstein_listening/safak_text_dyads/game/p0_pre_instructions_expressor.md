Soon, you will be asked to have a text-based conversation with another participant in the study about the topic that **YOUR PARTNER WILL INTRODUCE**.

As you text your conversation partner, please do your best to try to **EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS** to them.

They may even disagree with you about the topic, but whether or not you disagree please make a great effort to demonstrate you have meaningful views that you can share, you have a useful perspective, and you value your views.
