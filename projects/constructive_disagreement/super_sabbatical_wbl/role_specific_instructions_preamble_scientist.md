In this exercise, you and your partner will be taking on the role of a "Star Scientist" and a "Provost" in a discussion about the scientist's planned sabbatical.

Your assigned role in this discussion will be the **Star Scientist**.

The next page will contain reading materials for your role. **Please consider jotting down notes as you read.** While you will be able to access these materials again during the discussion, taking notes may help you to understand the content better.
