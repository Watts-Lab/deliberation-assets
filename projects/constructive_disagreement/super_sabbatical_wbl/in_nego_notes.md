# Your Deal Notes

**Please use this space to take notes about your deal, in as much detail as possible**.\* You should think about the following:

- How much (in $) is the price of the IP portfolio?
- Are there any special terms and conditions to the deal?
- Will the Scientist's trip take place?
- Will the Scientist have a "return fund?"

You will be asked about this information in your post-negotiation deal sheet, so write down everything you can!
