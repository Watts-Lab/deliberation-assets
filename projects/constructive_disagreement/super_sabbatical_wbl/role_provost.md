# Your assigned role is the Provost.

Below, we provide you with information about your role, as well as general information about the context of this negotiation. You will also be able to reference this information again during the main negotiation.

## Role Information

You are the Provost of your university, a top-tier institution with a world-renowned faculty famous for excellence in research and teaching. As the university’s senior academic officer, you oversee the framework that governs all faculty hiring, promotion and firing. Also, you personally approve all sabbatical requests.

These duties require a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, you need to make offers that attract the best and brightest minds; on the other, you must also safeguard the academic integrity of the university’s faculty and teaching staff by avoiding deals that create a mercenary culture. This tension is heightened in negotiations with star faculty who have built up large and potentially valuable patent portfolios. Therefore, you take the role of lead negotiator in the case of potential departures or new hires that present such tensions.

Beyond the watchdog aspect of being Provost, however, the role also includes supporting and encouraging faculty to do work that has an impact not only on their academic fields and literatures, but also on society more broadly. For faculty in science and technology, a practical strategy for doing this is to encourage and reward development of valuable intellectual property (IP). Among other strategies, one important way of doing this is to support faculty in developing and realising financial rewards from the sale or licensing of patents.

Recently, the university initiated a 10-year plan to ramp up its level of patenting and licensing activity. A special IP Committee of the Trustees has been convened to oversee this push, and a select group of alumni and donors have created a seed fund to support development of partnerships that will go beyond the historical technology transfer office models of the past. The idea is to understand which fields industry leaders see as commercially promising and then direct scarce resources to support patenting efforts for faculty in those areas.

The negotiation you are about to conduct is an interesting test case for this new initiative. From a rising star in a dynamic interdisciplinary field, you have before you a request for sabbatical and for a buy-out of the faculty member’s interest in the university’s patent portfolio in this new field.

Since the primary goals of this initiative are faculty retention and revenue enhancement, you are concerned about the precedent set by buying out a faculty member’s position in a patent portfolio prior to retirement --- and especially prior to a requested sabbatical. If you are too liberal with such requests, you risk the corporatisation of the university, and the spread of a mercenary culture of faculty. That would be disastrous for the university’s reputation and for its future.

On the retention front, this faculty member has just been invited to spend an academic year at the Institute for Advanced Studies --- a very prestigious distinction for both the faculty member and the university. It would be awful to lose such a star. You’ve asked around, and it seems highly unlikely that such an academic star would be asking for a pay-out to pursue some sort of commercial activity. You see little risk of losing this faculty member to industry. In contrast, there is a very real risk that you could lose this person to another university. Perhaps the right deal would help you bring your star home after the Institute visit.

Having weighed all of this and taken it to your IP Committee and a few select donors, you have their support to do a deal to retain this star, but there are limits.

In particular, the IP Committee has authorised you to pay up to £275,000 for the faculty member’s interest in patents.

As it turns out, one of the university’s new partners in patenting and licensing has found a serious buyer for these patents, so the risk is low and the upside is promising. Like you, however, the IP Committee is concerned about the precedent set by such deals, so they made it clear that they would not support a deal above £275,000.

On approving the sabbatical, the faculty member has more than earned it, and keeping precedent all but demands that you approve it.

You hope that the approved offer for the patents will be enough to inspire the faculty member to return from sabbatical for many years of productive research and academic leadership.

Now to negotiate ...
