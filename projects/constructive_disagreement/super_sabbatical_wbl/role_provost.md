# Your assigned role is the Provost.

Although you will be to reference this information later, **please consider jotting down notes as you read.**

## Role Information

As Provost of a top-tier global university, you oversee faculty hiring, promotion, firing, and personally approve all sabbatical requests. Your role requires creating a balance between attracting top talent and maintaining academic integrity, particularly when negotiating with star faculty holding valuable patents.

Supporting faculty to develop and monetize intellectual property (IP) is a key strategy. Recently, the university launched a 10-year plan to increase patenting and licensing activities, backed by an IP Committee and a seed fund from alumni and donors.

You now face a negotiation involving a faculty member who is a rising star in their field and requesting a sabbatical and buy-out of their patent interests. On the one hand, you are  concerned about setting a poor precedent in this case: you don’t want the university to become “corporatized,” and to encourage a mercenary culture among faculty. This is a university, not a business, and having too many faculty seek profit rather than scientific advancement poses an ethical issue that would be disastrous for the university’s reputation and future. 

On the other hand, you recognize the importance of retaining this faculty member, who has been invited to the prestigious Institute for Advanced Studies. They are extremely highly regarded in the global academic community, and there is a very real risk that you could lose this person to another university after they return from their sabbatical. Having the right deal would help you bring your star home after the Institute visit and motivate them to continue their productive work.

The IP Committee has authorized up to **$275,000** for the buy-out. While the university’s partners have already secured a serious buyer for the patent, making the overall risk low, the committee is very clear that you cannot, under any circumstances, exceed this limit.

The faculty member's sabbatical request is well-earned and should be approved, and they are entitled to **6 months** paid time, with the possibility of longer unpaid leave. 

In this negotiation, you aim to finalize a deal that ensures their return post-sabbatical for continued productive research and leadership.

Now to negotiate...
