# Your assigned role is the Provost.

Although you will be to reference this information later, **please consider jotting down notes as you read.**

## Role Information

As the Provost of a prestigious global university, you are responsible for faculty hiring, promotions, and terminations, and you personally approve all sabbatical requests. Your role requires balancing attracting top talent with maintaining academic integrity, especially when dealing with distinguished faculty holding valuable patents. However, in recent years, retaining talent has become increasingly challenging. Many star scientists have departed, lured by higher rewards and fewer working hours. Not only has the university lost prestige and grant funding in the past due to the departure of a star scientist, but other scientists have also followed them to their new post, creating more roles to fill. The pressure to retain top scientists is immense — so much so that it has been made clear that another resignation would jeopardize your position. This looming threat has left you feeling extremely anxious. 

A key strategy that you have identified for retaining top talent, is to support faculty to develop and monetize intellectual property (IP) Recently, the university launched a 10-year plan to increase patenting and licensing activities, backed by an IP Committee and a seed fund from alumni and donors.

You now face a negotiation involving a faculty member who is a rising star in their field and is requesting a sabbatical and buy-out of their patent interests. On the one hand, you are concerned about setting a poor precedent in this case: you don’t want the university to become “corporatized,” creating a mercenary culture among faculty. This is a university, not a business, and having too many faculty seek profit rather than scientific advancement poses an ethical issue that would be disastrous for the university’s reputation and future.

On the other hand, you recognize the importance of retaining this faculty member, who has been invited to the prestigious Institute for Advanced Studies. They are extremely highly regarded in the global academic community, and there is a very real risk that you could lose this person to another university or research center after they return from their sabbatical. Having the right deal would help you bring your star home after the Institute visit and motivate them to continue their productive work.

The IP Committee has authorized up to **$275,000** for the buy-out, which you should interpret as the total valuation of the portfolio. This means that 100\% of the portfolio is worth $275K; any partial share of the patent pool needs to be scaled relative to the total valuation.

While the university’s partners have already secured a serious buyer for the patent, making the overall risk low, the committee is very clear that _you cannot, under any circumstances, exceed the $275K limit_.

The faculty member's sabbatical request is well-earned and should be approved, and they are entitled to **6 months paid time (at a standard salary of $10,000 per month)**, with the possibility of longer unpaid leave.

In this negotiation, you aim to finalize a deal that ensures their return post-sabbatical for continued productive research and leadership.

Before you start your negotiation, here is a summary of the boundaries of your negotiation. You can go off script as much as you like, but you MUST act within the set boundaries:
- You cannot pay more than **$275,000** for the star scientist’s IP (100% of the portfolio).
- You can buy less than all of the portfolio, but it needs to be scaled to the total valuation; for example, your **max for 50% would be $137,500**.
- Failure to heed these rules will lead to losing your job.  
- You **must retain** the star scientist or risk losing your own job.
- You cannot authorize more than **6 months of paid sabbatical**. You can, however, offer longer sabbaticals up to 24 months away.

Now to negotiate...
