# Please take a moment to write down your strategy for this negotiation.

Studies have shown that negotiators tend to perform better when they plan beforehand! Thus, reflecting on your role and the information you have just reviewed, please take a moment to think about how you plan to achieve your goals in this negotiation.

You may want to consider:

- Your **target price**: what monetary value do you hope to achieve?
- Your **opening bid**: what value do you want to open with? (You may not want to put all your cards on the table right away!)
- Your **outside options**: what would happen if you weren't able to achieve a deal? What is your next best option? This might help you inform your goals!
