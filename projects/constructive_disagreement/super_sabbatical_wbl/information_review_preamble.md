# Welcome to the "Super Sabbatical" Exercise!

In this exercise, you and your partner will be taking on the role of a "Star Scientist" and the "Provost" in a discussion about the scientist's planned sabbatical.

In the next page, you will see some additional details and reminders about your role --- think of this as a "pep talk" before beginning the negotiation! You will also have the opportunity to quickly review the content you received before coming to class. All of this information will be made available to you again during the negotiation.
