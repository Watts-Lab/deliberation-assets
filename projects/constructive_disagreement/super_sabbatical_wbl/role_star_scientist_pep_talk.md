# Key Things to Remember: Star Scientist.

After a very long period of overwork, the physical and emotional toll is such that, on your doctorâ€™s orders, you need a long break. Your goal is to get 21 months away: 12 months of time off to decompress and sail in the Pacific, and 9 months of creative freedom to pursue new ideas in the Institute.

You need at least **$355,000** in order to make this dream possible, **and you have already sold your condo and taken on significant financial commitments**. Your conversation with the Provost is the only way for you to complete the deal you have committed to and to begin your leave as soon as possible.

This makes your conversation with the Provost crucial. As you enter this conversation, remember that you are a high-profile scientist --- a *rising star*. You will be snatched up quickly if things do not work out with the Provost. In light of these facts, be as assertive as you can.

This conversation is the best chance for you to get the $355K and secure both your financial and your physical well-being.
