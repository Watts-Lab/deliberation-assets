# Key Things to Remember: Star Scientist.

- **You need a break:** After a very long period of overwork, the physical and emotional toll has caused your doctor to insist that you take time away. Your goal is to take **21 months** of sabbatical: 12 months of time off to decompress and sail in the Pacific, and 9 months of creative freedom to pursue new ideas in the Institute.
- You need at least **$355,000** in order to make this dream possible: $260,000 for the boating trip, and $95,000 upon your return, as you need to find a new place to live, get a car, and restart your career.
- **You have already sold your condo and taken on significant financial commitments**. You need a deal _now_, or else you will lose your down payment and find yourself without a place to stay.
- You are a high-profile scientist --- a **rising star**. You will be snatched up quickly if things do not work out with the Provost, and losing you will hurt the university. Use this as leverage, and feel **free to get creative**.
