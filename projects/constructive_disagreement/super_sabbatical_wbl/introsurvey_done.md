# You are now done with the introductory steps.

When you click the "continue" button below, you will enter a lobby to wait until you are matched with a partner. This should take less than two minutes.

After you are assigned a partner, we will give you detailed information about the role you are playing in the negotiation.

**Note that you will need to read a substantial amount of background material to prepare for your role.** Please take a moment to get a pen/pencil/notepad or other material for taking notes in the next stage.
