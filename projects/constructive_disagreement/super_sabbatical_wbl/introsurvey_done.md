# You are now done with introductory surveys and will be assigned to a role in the next stage.

By pressing the "continue" button below, you will be taken to a "lobby" in which you will wait to be assigned with a partner (which should take no more than a minute or two). Once you are assigned a partner, you will be directed to begin reading about your role.

**Note: once you are assigned a role, there will be significant reading material associated with this study.** We strongly recommend that you take a moment to get a pen/pencil/notepad or other material for taking notes in the next stage.
