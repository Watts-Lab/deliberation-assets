# Key Things to Remember: Provost.

- In this negotiation, you must balance two competing objectives: (1) retaining a stellar faculty member, whose departure would threaten the department's prestige and may cost you your job; and (2) following the rules of the university, which are are necessary for maintaining the broader precedents and culture of the institution.

- The rules state that the maximum you can pay for 100% of the faculty member's patent pool is **$275,000**. All partial purchases should scale to this maximum; for a 40% share, for example, you cannot pay more than **$110K** ($275K \* 0.4).

- You also cannot pay for more than **6 months** of sabbatical (typically at a salary of $10,000 per month), though you can approve longer leave times (up to 24 months). Giving world-class scholars the freedom and flexibility to work at their best is very important to you and your institution.

- **Feel free to get creative:** outside of the hard rules, you can offer a variety of other inducements to get your star scientist back to the university and ready to continue their productive work.
