# Key Things to Remember: Provost.

At most universities, the Provost is the senior leader in charge of all things related to faculty, research, and teaching. Recruiting and retaining star faculty is a very important element of the job, but so is maintaining a health culture for the entire community. 

To that end, you must not agree to any provision of a deal that would create an unsustainable precedent. Specifically, there are two things you cannot agree; either one will get you removed from your post. 

First, do not agree to more than **6 months** paid sabbatical, though you can approve longer leave times. Departments routinely approve up to a year, and in rare cases the Provost allows longer leaves --- normally only to members of staff who are clearly stars in some way. 

Second, you may not exceed the maximum authorised payment and / or valuation for the scientistâ€™s IP. The maximum you can pay for their share of the lab patent pool is **$275K**, but because this is about managing risk, you should use that as the maximum valuation you can pay for any amount of their holdings. So for 40% of their share, you cannot pay more than **$110K** ($275K * 0.4). 

Subject to avoiding these problems, you can offer a variety of other inducements to get your star back and in good condition, and that is your best outcome. If you cannot reach an agreement in which they return rested and happy to be back, not having them back will be a disappointment but still better than having them return feeling either still too tired to work or just not happy to be back.
