# Negotiation Background: Optional Reading

You have now completed the introductory surveys. To help you understand the context for this negotiation, you may optionally read the following general information.

## General Information

In recent decades, the lines between academic and practical research have blurred. Interdisciplinary fields such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, data science, and machine learning have forged new connections between business and academia and created new demands for applied work. In light of excellent outside options in industry, competition has become more intense, and it has become harder for universities to retain top researchers.

To improve faculty retention, universities are now offering creative incentives, such as helping faculty submit patents and build valuable IP portfolios even within academia. In addition, universities are also allowing faculty to sell the patents that result from their research --- obtaining both a financial profit and a better chance to apply their work in a broad commercial setting.

Critics argue that these commercialization efforts can detract from basic research. As more researchers seek to make their work profitable rather than scientifically interesting, top scholars may seek out elite research centers — creating a backlash in which the best academics flock to “think tanks” and “institutes” to avoid having to work in an increasingly corporatized university culture.

To balance these considerations, your university allows faculty to sell patent interests while retaining the right of first refusal, ensuring that high-value portfolios are maintained. An investment-minded IP Committee evaluates these transactions to secure the best prices.

Additionally, the university offers sabbaticals to enhance faculty effectiveness. Faculty with eight or more years of service receive full salary for up to six months, or partial support for a year-long leave. Sabbaticals are granted based on a detailed plan of study or project and require departmental and administrative approval, although reasonable plans are almost always approved for qualifying faculty.

Combining these retention strategies presents both challenges and opportunities for the university and its researchers. This balance serves as the backdrop for the negotiation that you are about to take part in.
