# Negotiation Background: Optional Reading

You have now completed the introductory surveys. To help you understand the context for this negotiation, you may optionally read the following general information.

## General Information

In recent decades, the lines between academic and practical research have blurred. Interdisciplinary fields such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, data science, and machine learning have forged new connections between business and academia and created new demands for applied work.

In addition to the opportunities researchers face in industry, a number of nonprofit research centers offer ideal environments for focused thinking and vibrant interactions with motivated colleagues. Even better, these centers require no teaching, no burdensome committee work, and no pressure to commercialize research.

In light of excellent outside options outside of the university, competition for talent has become more intense, and it has become harder for universities to retain top researchers.

To improve faculty retention, universities are now offering creative incentives, such as helping faculty submit patents and build valuable IP portfolios within academia. In addition, universities are also allowing faculty to sell the patents that result from their research --- obtaining both a financial profit and a better chance to apply their work in a broad commercial setting.

Additionally, the university offers sabbaticals to enhance faculty effectiveness. Faculty with eight or more years of service receive full salary for up to six months, or partial support for a year-long leave. Sabbaticals are granted based on a detailed plan of study or project and require departmental and administrative approval, although reasonable plans are almost always approved for qualifying faculty.

The integration of these retention strategies poses challenges and opportunities for both the university and its researchers. This dynamic balance between the desires of the institution and individual researchers sets the stage for the negotiation you are entering.
