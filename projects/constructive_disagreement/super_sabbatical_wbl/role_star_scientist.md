# Your assigned role is the Applicant, a Star Scientist.

Although you will be to reference this information later, **please consider jotting down notes as you read.**

## Role Information

You are a professor at a top-tier global university, and over the last decade, you have achieved your dream career as a well-renowned scholar at the forefront of your interdisciplinary field. Given the star that you are, you have not only published multiple award-winning papers in your field, but have also built up a portfolio of patents that are of considerable value. However, these achievements have come at the cost of routinely working 14-hour days that have left you exhausted and creatively drained. Managing a productive lab and training PhD students has left little time for thinking, and your doctor insists you need a break before you suffer a total physical and mental breakdown.

On these doctor’s orders --- and because a break has been long overdue --- you’ve accepted a 9-month invitation to the Institute for Advanced Studies, where you’ll finally get the opportunity to recharge your creative batteries. On top of that, you first plan an extended vacation for yourself and your partner, in which you intend to spend 12 months sailing in the South Pacific and visiting Maui. You’ve dreamed about taking a trip like this since you were a teenager, and you truly feel that you’ve earned it.

You therefore wish to take a **21-month sabbatical** (12 months sailing and 9 months at the Institute), and you need significant funding to make the trip happen. You have already sold your condo to make a $100,000 down payment on a boat in Marina Del Rey, where you intend to set sail. You will also need funding for the following additional expenses:

- An additional **$150,000** to pay off the boat. If you cannot pay this amount, you will lose 20% of your $100,000 down payment.
- **$50,000** for boating-related equipment.
- **$35,000** for living expenses (e.g., food, clothing, insurance).
- **$25,000** for maintenance, totalling $260,000 in trip-related expenses.
- An additional **$95,000** for a "return fund," so you can restart your academic life. That amount would get you through finding a place to live, perhaps buying a car, and having the leverage needed to slot back into work on your terms --- either at your current university or at one of several that have expressed interest in luring you away given your “rising star” status. 

In sum, you need at least **$355,000** to fund your trip, or you will jeopardize your entire plan. Ideally, you would like to raise more funds, but those are not essential to the viability of the sabbatical. If you cannot raise sufficient funds, you will not go on sabbatical and will remain in your current post. 

Your only way to raise this money is by selling your share of the patent portfolio. You strongly prefer selling to your university for a quick deal. While private investors offer several options, they all have less upfront payment, much longer timelines, and more risk that they will fall through. However, you have heard through the grapevine that a colleague was recently able to sell their patent portfolio to a private company for nearly $400,000, even though his patents are considered less valuable than yours.

Overall, your first choice is a deal with the Provost, who handles all intellectual property deals. This is the fastest and surest way to start your adventure.

Before you start your negotiation, here is a summary of the boundaries of your negotiation. You can go off script as much as you like, but you MUST act within the set boundaries:
- You MUST find a way to make your sabbatical happen, in a form as close to your ideal (12 months sailing + 9 months at the Institute) as possible. Continuing to work at your current pace without a break poses a serious risk to your health and career. 
- Additionally, you do NOT want to lose the 20% down payment on your boat. Since you have already sold your condo, you will need to secure a new place to live if you do not go on the trip.
- To be able to accept the position at the Institute of Advanced Studies, you **must reach an agreement with the provost**, as private companies would be too risky and slow.

Now to negotiate...
