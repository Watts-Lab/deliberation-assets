# Your assigned role is the Applicant, a Star Scientist.

Below, we provide you with information about your role, as well as general information about the context of this negotiation. You will also be able to reference this information again during the main negotiation.

## Role Information

Over the last ten years or so, you have earned the admiration of your field and realised the career you always dreamed of, but all that is now at risk. The 14-hour days you routinely worked to pursue your dreams have left you depleted of the creative energies required to enjoy your work, let alone sustain it. As your lab gained momentum and attracted PhD students and postdocs, you have become extremely productive, but you have also become increasingly occupied with training and management. Thinking time has become scarce.

At the same time, your GP has become annoyingly persistent in urging you to find a way to recharge your batteries, so to speak. Retirement is a distant future, but you are no longer young enough to pursue an idea without regard for your body --- as you often have done. You’ve begun to show indicators of health concerns that warrant a change. Although you don’t like to admit it, you realise that enjoying the life you’ve worked hard to build means taking an extended sabbatical, especially from your teaching and lab management responsibilities.

So you said an enthusiastic “yes!” to an invitation to spend 9 months at the Institute for Advanced Studies. With timing negotiable, however, you realise going now would be a waste of the extraordinary opportunity to do some new thinking. To make the most of the Institute time, therefore, now is the time to take a travel adventure you’ve dreamt about since adolescence: a South Pacific sailing adventure and an extended visit --- for fun, not work! --- to volcanoes, observatories, and beaches of Maui, Hawaii.

Never one for dithering, you’ve already sold your flat to raise the £100,000 down payment you need for the boat you really wanted, and it is now moored and waiting for you in Marina Del Rey, California. The plan is that you and your partner will fly to Los Angeles, sneak off to Vegas for an overdue no-fuss wedding, and then set sail from Marina Del Rey for Maui where you’ll stay for at least 6 months before making your way back east, through the Panama Canal, and up the US East Coast to New York --- arriving in mid-September.

To round out the expenses for the trip, you owe another £150,000 to pay off the boat and an additional £50,000 to outfit it so a crew of two can safely sail it; both bills must be paid in full before you depart. Also, you anticipate needing £35,000 for food, clothing, insurance, and the like for the 11 months or so that you will be living on the boat. Finally, you estimate that you need at least £25,000 available for boat maintenance and repairs. These are optimistic estimates, so it could take more. You’re now living in a small rental near campus. Space is tight, so your familiar furniture and other household items are in long-term storage. Thus, you are really ready to leave and begin your trip as soon as possible.

The last piece of the puzzle is that you will need a £95,000 “return fund” to restart your life after your Institute visit. That amount would get you through finding a place to live, perhaps buying a car, and having the leverage needed to slot back into work on your terms --- either at your current university or at one of several that have expressed interest in luring you away. For the sake of your health and to achieve the goals you’ve set for the next chapter of your career, it is important that you not get sucked right back into managing a large lab.

In sum, realising your dream now depends on raising at least £355,000, and your only way to do that is to persuade the Provost to buy out your share of the patent portfolio developed around your research. This £355,000 doesn’t count the down payment on the boat because that just shifts equity from the flat to the boat. Any less than that, and your whole plan will be in jeopardy. What’s worse, you could lose 20% of your down payment on the boat if you are unable to complete the purchase.

Your first choice is to sell to your university. You are ready to leave now, and this represents the fastest and surest option to get going on your trip. The negotiation will be with the Provost, the university officer ultimately in charge of all intellectual property deals.

Although it would take longer, your alternative is to sell to one of several private investor groups that have shown strong interest in your area. One such investor is a partnership of the kind sometimes referred to as “patent trolls.” While their deal would likely ultimately yield higher total payment, the upfront payment is smaller; it is essentially just a payment for the right to broker a sale. If a deal is done, it could take a year or more. A second potential buyer is a large corporation that recently did a deal with a colleague of yours who does similar work. Thanks to your colleague’s immodest bragging, you have a pretty good idea that the company paid him something close to £400,000 for his share of patents that most regard as less valuable than yours.

On balance, however, it’s clear that doing a deal with your Provost is the only potential deal that really works for you.

Now to negotiate ...
