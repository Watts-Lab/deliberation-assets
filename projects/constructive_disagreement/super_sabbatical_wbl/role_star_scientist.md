# Your assigned role is the Applicant, a Star Scientist.

Although you will be to reference this information later, **please consider jotting down notes as you read.**

## Role Information

You are a professor at a top-tier global university, and over the last decade, you have achieved your dream career as a well-renowned scholar at the forefront of your interdisciplinary field. However, these achievements have come at the cost of routinely working 14-hour days that have left you exhausted and creatively drained. Managing a productive lab and training PhD students has left little time for thinking, and your doctor insists you need a break before you suffer a total physical and mental breakdown.

On these doctor’s orders --- and because a break has been long overdue --- you’ve accepted a 9-month invitation to the Institute for Advanced Studies, where you’ll finally get the opportunity to recharge your creative batteries. On top of that, you first plan an extended vacation for yourself and your partner, in which you intend to spend 12 months sailing in the South Pacific and visiting Maui. You’ve dreamed about taking a trip like this since you were a teenager, and you truly feel that you’ve earned it.

You therefore wish to take a **21-month sabbatical** (12 months sailing, and 9 months at the Institute), and you need significant funding to make the trip happen. You have already sold your condo to make a $100,000 down payment on a boat in Marina Del Rey, where you intend to set sail. You will also need funding for the following additional expenses:

- An additional **$150,000** to pay off the boat. If you cannot pay this amount, you will lose 20% of your $100,000 down payment.
- **$50,000** for boating-related equipment.
- **$35,000** for living expenses (e.g., food, clothing, insurance).
- **$25,000** for maintenance, totalling $260,000.
- **$95,000** for a "return fund," so that you can restart your academic life. Given your “rising star” status, several universities have offered you competing positions after your sabbatical. For the sake of your health and to achieve the goals you’ve set for the next chapter of your career, you want to make the right decision.

In sum, you need **$355,000** to fund your trip, or you will jeopardize your entire plan.

Your only way to raise this money is by selling your share of the patent portfolio. You strongly prefer selling to your university for a quick deal. While private investors offer several options, they all have less upfront payment and much longer timelines. Some deals require a year or more of delay. However, you have heard through the grapevine that a colleague was recently able to sell their patent portfolio to a private company for nearly $400,000, even though his patents are considered less valuable than yours.

Overall, your first choice is a deal with the Provost, who handles all intellectual property deals. This is the fastest and surest way to start your adventure.

Now to negotiate...
