# Your Deal Sheet

Please use the form below to record the final agreement in your negotiation. You and your partner must separately enter your deals. **You must fill out all questions of the deal sheet before you are able to submit.** If you are unable to reach an agreement, you may write "no deal" in lieu of the value and terms.

If your deal sheet is complete, a "Submit" button will appear after 10 minutes. This button will allow you to finalize your deal and end the negotiation. While you can update your deal as many times as you need until the end of the discussion period, once you press the "Submit" button, your deal cannot be changed.
