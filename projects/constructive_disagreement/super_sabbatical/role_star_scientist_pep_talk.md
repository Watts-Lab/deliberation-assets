# A Message for the Star Scientist.

After a very long period of overwork, the physical and emotional toll is such that, on your doctor’s orders, you need a long break. Your goal is to get 21 months away ... 12 months of time off to decompress by sailing in the Pacific and 9 months in the Institute. 

As you read the Star Scientist’s predicament, I can well imagine many of you shaking your heads in disapproval at the rash decisions the Star Scientist made to commit to the boat and the trip before having got all the required funds together. This makes your conversation with the Provost very important. 

As you come to that conversation, however, do your best to step into the star scientist role. Taking inspiration from stars you have admired, rock your "inner diva," and know that you will be snatched up quickly if things do not work out with the Provost. 

The only catch is, the Provost is the only way for you to complete the deal you have committed to and start your leave soon, which is important to your well-being.
