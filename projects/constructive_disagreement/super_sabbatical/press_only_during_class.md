# You have now completed the basic introductory steps to Deliberation Lab and all required technology checks.

You may now "log out" of Deliberation Lab by closing this tab, as no further actions are required until the start of class.

Please press the "Start Exercise" button below ONLY when you have arrived in class for your exercise. This will activate the next stage in the exercise, in which you will be paired with a partner to complete the activity.
