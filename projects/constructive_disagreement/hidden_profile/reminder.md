Information about job candidates is always incomplete and there may be no best candidate for the job. It is possible that all three candidates would perform competently as president, each possessing his or her own strengths and weaknesses. Nevertheless, every selection committee must ultimately make a choice based on beliefs about which candidate is most likely to excel, given the information available.
