# Instructions

In this exercise, you and a randomly assigned partner will take turns sharing stories about something you have eaten in the last month that was absolutely amazing –– beyond delicious!

First, you will have two minutes to introduce yourselves.
Then, each of you will have one minute to answer a question we will provide.

In your one minute turn, do your best to paint a word picture that helps your partner understand why, for you, this food was "So Good!"

When the discussion is over, you will complete a short writing exercise.
