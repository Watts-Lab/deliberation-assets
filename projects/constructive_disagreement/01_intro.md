# Intro: Ocean Survival

In this study, we are interested in how people collaborate and solve problems. For this reason, you will be asked to solve an exercise designed to test your leadership, teamwork and persuasiveness skills. These skills are valued by employers. You may find that entry level interviews and assessment days may ask you to perform a similar task. We shall ask you to come up with a solution with your team member, answer some questions about you and your partner and provide some feedback.

Please be completely honest in your responses. There are no "right" or "wrong" answers. Your responses will remain anonymous and confidential to you and your team members and those involved in this research.
