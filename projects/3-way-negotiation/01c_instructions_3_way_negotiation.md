# You have been selected to represent **ORGANIZATION C**.

Your goal in these negotiations is to ensure that *Organization C* gets as much of the benefits as possible in the time allotted.

Below are a few key reminders:

- You will be placed in a chat with the other participants. You should use this chat to discuss how you and the other organizations plan to split the points, and you will have **10 minutes** to reach an agreement.
- All proposals and agreements should take place within the chat. 
- You must fill out a final deal sheet by the end of the discussion.
- **In order to be part of an agreement, each party must submit matching deal sheets. Your deal sheet must also add up to the correct total from the Schedule of Benefits.**
- Blank deal sheets, or deal sheets that do not add up to the correct total point value, will be considered invalid and awarded 0 points.
- Any proposal to split 121 points requires the acceptance of all three parties. (*ALL THREE of your deal sheets must match!*)
- Proposals involving two parties only require only the acceptance of the two parties involved. (*Only TWO of the three deal sheets need to match!*) If you are excluded, you can indicate this on your deal sheet.
- You can change your deal sheet as many times as you want before the deadline.
- When the 10 minutes are over, the values you entered in the deal sheet become final.
- Everyone has access to the same information. Your goal is to maximize benefits for your organization, as it is uncertain whether you will have any future dealings with the other parties.
