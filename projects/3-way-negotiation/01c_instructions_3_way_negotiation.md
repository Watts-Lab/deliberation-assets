# You represent **ORGANIZATION C**.

In the next stage, you will be placed in a chat with the other participants. You should use this chat to discuss how you and the other organizations plan to split the points, and you will have **10 minutes** to reach an agreement.

Your goal in these negotiations is to ensure that *Organization C* gets as much of the benefits as possible in the time allotted. Remember that each point you earn represents a lottery ticket towards a **$10 bonus**.

Below are a few key reminders:

- To get 121 points, all three of you must agree to a deal. However, you can also choose to have a deal involving just two parties and earn fewer points (as specified in the Schedule of Benefits).
- All proposals and agreements should take place within the chat. 
- You must fill out a final deal sheet by the end of the discussion.
- **Everyone involved in a deal must have matching deal sheets.** If your deal sheet does not match the others', we will assume that you are excluded from the deal and award you 0 points.
- **Your deal sheet must add up to the correct total from the Schedule of Benefits.**
- You can change your deal sheet as many times as you want before the deadline. When the 10 minutes are over, the values you entered in the deal sheet become final.
- Everyone has access to the same information. Your goal is to maximize benefits for your organization, as it is uncertain whether you will have any future dealings with the other parties.
