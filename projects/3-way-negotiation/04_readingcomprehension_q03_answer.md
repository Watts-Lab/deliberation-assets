## Answer to Q3: 34.

According to the Schedule of Benefits, a deal between A and B generates 118 points. A deal between A and C generates 84 points. Therefore, 118-84 = 34.

Pay close attention to the different numbers of points that different combinations of the organizations can generate. This may affect how you approach the negotiation!
