# Please Negotiate Now: You have 10 minutes to reach an agreement.

Here is a reminder of the Ground Rules:

- Any proposal to split 121 points requires the acceptance of all three parties to become an agreement.  
- Proposals involving two parties only require the acceptance of the two parties involved, and the total number of points distributed has to conform to the schedule of benefits.  
- You are permitted to make as many offers as you wish in the allotted time.  If you reach an agreement before the deadline, new offers can be made by any of the parties and new agreements may be reached, up until this deadline.  
- Offers from the outsider (excluded party) to a 2-way agreement do not invalidate the 2-way agreement unless accepted by one or both of the insiders.
