Organizations A, B and C, each have designated a representative to participate in a three-way negotiation.

# You have been selected to represent **ORGANIZATION B**.

The three groups have been told by a higher authority that there are benefits to be had if they work together.  Indeed, if A, B and C can agree to work together they can share benefits totaling 121.  How they want to divide the benefits is up to them, but they will only receive these benefits if all three parties agree upon their exact allocation.  If only two of the parties agree to work together, there are lesser amounts of benefits available (see schedule at the bottom of this page).  

But again, any combination of parties that decides to work together must agree on how to split the benefits of cooperation.  Any division of these benefits is permissible, but only one agreement is possible.  Without an agreement, all parties get zero benefits. 


# Your Goal

Your goal in these negotiations is to ensure that Organization B gets as much of the benefits as possible in the time allotted.  All representatives have received this same information and have been empowered to commit their organizations.  It is uncertain whether you will have any future dealings with the other parties.


# Ground Rules

Any proposal to split 121 points requires the acceptance of all three parties to become an agreement.  Proposals involving two parties only require the acceptance of the two parties involved, and the total number of points distributed has to conform to the schedule of benefits.  You are permitted to make as many offers as you wish in the allotted time.  If you reach an agreement before the deadline, new offers can be made by any of the parties and new agreements may be reached, up until this deadline.  Offers from the outsider (excluded party) to a 2-way agreement do not invalidate the 2-way agreement unless accepted by one or both of the insiders.
