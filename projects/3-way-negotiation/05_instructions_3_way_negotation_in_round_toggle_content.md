## Ground Rules

- All proposals and agreements should take place within the chat. 
- You must fill out a final deal sheet by the end of the discussion. The deal sheet will become available in the interface after 5 minutes have elapsed.
- Your agreement will be "confirmed" if your deal sheet matches what is submitted by the other parties, and if the numbers match the points specified in the Schedule of Benefits.
- **In order to be part of an agreement, each party must submit matching deal sheets. If your final deal sheet does not match what the other parties submit, the deal is rendered invalid and you will get 0 points.**
- Blank deal sheets, or deal sheets that do not add up to the correct total point value, will also be considered invalid.
- Any proposal to split 121 points requires the acceptance of all three parties to become an agreement. (*This means ALL THREE of your deal sheets must match!*)
- Proposals involving two parties only require only the acceptance of the two parties involved. (*This means only TWO of the three deal sheets need to match!*) The party with a non-matching deal sheet will be assumed to excluded from the deal and will receive 0 points.
- You may use the chat to make as many offers as you wish within the 10-minute discussion period. If you reach an agreement before the deadline, new offers can be made by any of the parties and new agreements may be reached, up until this deadline. You can change the submission in your deal sheet as many times as you want before the deadline.
- When the 10 minutes are over, the values you entered in the deal sheet become final.
