## Ground Rules

- To get 121 points, all three of you must agree to a deal. However, you can also choose to have a deal involving just two parties and earn fewer points (as specified in the Schedule of Benefits).
- All proposals and agreements should take place within the chat. 
- You must fill out a final deal sheet by the end of the discussion.
- **Your deal sheet must add up to the correct total from the Schedule of Benefits.**
- You can change your deal sheet as many times as you want before the deadline. When the 10 minutes are over, the values you entered in the deal sheet become final.
- Everyone has access to the same information. Your goal is to maximize benefits for your organization, as it is uncertain whether you will have any future dealings with the other parties.
