notes: Instructions for the 3-way negotiation activity
---

In this activity, you will represent one of Organizations A, B, or C in a three-way negotiation.

Your goal is to decide how to split a pool of points, gaining as many points for your organization as possible. Depending on how the three of you choose to work together, different amounts of points are available in the pool.

- **If all three of you agree to a deal, 121 total points are possible.** 
- **If only two out of three parties join the deal, lesser amounts of points are available.** (Please see the Schedule of Benefits at the bottom of this page.)
- **If you are left out of a deal, or if there is no deal, you get no points.**

You can choose to divide the points however you’d like, but only one agreement is possible. At the end of the discussion period, all three of you will submit a “deal sheet” containing your final decision. You can update the deal sheet as many times as you want until the 10-minute discussion period ends. However, **everyone involved in a deal must have matching deal sheets.**

The deal sheet also needs to match the Schedule of Benefits in order to count (i.e., it must add up to the correct total number of points). When checking that your deal sheets match the Schedule of Benefits, we will round to the nearest whole number (e.g., 120.9 to 121). Mismatched deal sheets will get 0 points.

All three parties have the same information. Remember that your goal is to maximize benefits for your organization, as it is uncertain whether you will have any future dealings with the other parties.
