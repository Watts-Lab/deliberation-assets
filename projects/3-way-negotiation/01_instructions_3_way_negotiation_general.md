notes: Instructions for the 3-way negotiation activity
---

In this activity, you will represent one of Organizations A, B, or C in a three-way negotiation.

Your goal is to decide how to split a pool of points, gaining as many points for your organization as possible. Depending on how the three of you choose to work together, different amounts of points are available in the pool.

- **If all three of you agree to a shared deal, 121 points are possible.** This means that you get to split 121 points three ways.
- **However, only two out of three parties need to agree to a deal.** Depending on which parties are involved, two-way deals have different point values. For example, a deal between A and B is worth 118 points; a deal between A and C is worth 84 points; and a deal between B and C is worth 50 points. Please refer to the Schedule of Benefits at the bottom of this page.
- **If you are left out of a deal, or if there is no deal, you get no points.**

In any deal, you can choose to divide the points however you’d like. At the end of the discussion period, all three of you will submit a “deal sheet” containing your final decision, along with the amount of points each organization gets. You can update the deal sheet as many times as you want until the end of the 10-minute discussion period.

Everyone involved in a deal should submit matching deal sheets. For example, if A and B agree to a two-way agreement, then A and B’s deal sheets must match, and C can indicate that they were excluded. In a three-way agreement, all three deal sheets must match. 

Finally, the deal sheet needs to match the Schedule of Benefits in order to count (i.e., it must add up to the correct total number of points). When checking that your deal sheets match, we will round to the nearest whole number (rounding 120.9 to 121). If your deal sheets do not match appropriately, you will get 0 points.

All three parties have the same information. Remember that your goal is to maximize benefits for your organization, as it is uncertain whether you will have any future dealings with the other parties.
