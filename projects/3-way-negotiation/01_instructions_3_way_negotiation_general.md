Organizations A, B and C, each have designated a representative to participate in a three-way negotiation.

The three groups have been told by a higher authority that there are benefits to be had if they work together.  Indeed, if A, B and C can agree to work together they can share benefits totaling 121.  How they want to divide the benefits is up to them, but they will only receive these benefits if all three parties agree upon their exact allocation.  If only two of the parties agree to work together, there are lesser amounts of benefits available (see schedule at the bottom of this page).  

But again, any combination of parties that decides to work together must agree on how to split the benefits of cooperation.  Any division of these benefits is permissible, but only one agreement is possible.  Without an agreement, all parties get zero benefits. 


## Your Goal

Your goal in these negotiations is to ensure that your organization gets as much of the benefits as possible in the time allotted. All representatives have received the same information and have been empowered to commit to agreements on behalf of their organizations. It is uncertain whether you will have any future dealings with the other parties.


## Ground Rules

- You will be placed in a chat with the other participants. You should use this chat to discuss how you and the other organizations plan to split the points.
- You will have **10 minutes** to reach an agreement.
- All proposals and agreements should take place within the chat. 
- You must fill out a final deal sheet by the end of the discussion. The deal sheet will become available in the interface after 5 minutes have elapsed.
- Your agreement will be "confirmed" if your deal sheet matches what is submitted by the other parties, and if the numbers match the points specified in the Schedule of Benefits.
- **In order to be part of an agreement, each party must submit matching deal sheets. If your final deal sheet does not match what the other parties submit, the deal is rendered invalid and you will get 0 points.**
- Blank deal sheets, or deal sheets that do not add up to the correct total point value, will also be considered invalid.
- Any proposal to split 121 points requires the acceptance of all three parties to become an agreement. (*This means ALL THREE of your deal sheets must match!*)
- Proposals involving two parties only require only the acceptance of the two parties involved. (*This means only TWO of the three deal sheets need to match!*) The party with a non-matching deal sheet will be assumed to be excluded from the deal and will receive 0 points.
- You may use the chat to make as many offers as you wish within the 10-minute discussion period. If you reach an agreement before the deadline, new offers can be made by any of the parties and new agreements may be reached, up until this deadline. You can change the submission in your deal sheet as many times as you want before the deadline.
- When the 10 minutes are over, the values you entered in the deal sheet become final.
