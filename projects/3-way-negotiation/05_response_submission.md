# Your Deal Sheet

Please record your deal below. **All parties in an agreement must have matching deal sheets, and the total values must match the Schedule of Benefits.**

You can change your answers as many times as you want before the 10-minute discussion period ends. Once the time is up, your answers will become final.

If you reach an agreement early, a "Submit Now and End Negotiation" button will appear. Pressing this button will end the game and finalize your deal sheet.
