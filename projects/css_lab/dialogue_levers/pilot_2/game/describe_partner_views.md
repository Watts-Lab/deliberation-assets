# Describe your partner's views

Please summarize **your partner’s** position on the topic you discussed using language that **they** would say is accurate, complete, and fair.

Aim for one or two paragraphs that include:

- What your partner believes
- The reasons for their belief
- Their values and priorities about this topic
- Their personal experience with the topic (if any)

We will show your summary to your partner and ask them to rate its **accuracy**, **completeness**, and **fairness**.

You have 4 minutes for this exercise; the survey will advance after that time is elapsed.
