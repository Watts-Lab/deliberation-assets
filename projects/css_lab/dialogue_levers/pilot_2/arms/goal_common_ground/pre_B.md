## What you’ll do

You and your partner will be asked to adopt a shared goal for the conversation: **to look for any areas of agreement between your views**, even if you still differ in important ways.

Common ground might include shared values, similar concerns, or overlapping goals—large or small.

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Beginning with a shared goal gives both partners the same starting point for the discussion. When the goal is to look for common ground, it can guide you to notice points of agreement that may arise in the conversation.

## What to expect

At the beginning of the conversation, we’ll ask you and your partner to commit to this goal: to look for any areas of agreement between your perspectives, even if you still disagree.

After that, you’ll continue with a normal discussion of the topic.
