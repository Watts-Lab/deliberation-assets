# Instructions: Goal Setting - Joint Problem Solving

Before the conversation begins, participants are asked to commit to a goal of jointly developing a concrete, mutually acceptable way forward on the issue — a compromise, adjustment, or policy variation that acknowledges both perspectives. This intervention focuses on collaborative problem-solving: moving beyond argument to propose constructive possibilities that could reduce tension or address shared concerns, even if participants ultimately still disagree.

## Operationalization in the academic and practitioner literatures:

"Best practice is where the community is involved at the beginning of the process in setting the priorities and coming up with solutions." (Bastiaensen & Cook, 2021)
"People often agree on the issues affecting their communities, and have similar ideas for the solutions to those problems, yet they still feel like they’re at odds with one another based on their social or cultural identities… focusing on solutions instead of identities can make those conversations less charged and create a deeper sense of unity, as people appreciate the actual agreements they have."(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)
“It’s important to me that we work together and find a plan everyone can live with.”(Duhigg, 2024)
"[participants] were asked to engage in a discussion on the issue for about twenty minutes and prepare a joint statement. The quality of the joint position statement was used to determine the degree of tractability of each conflict (i.e., outcome measures)." (Kurt et al., 2014)
"each dyad discussed a moral issue… and tried to reach consensus by writing a joint position statement on which they both agreed and with which they felt comfortable. They were informed that the statement was to be shared anonymously with a “Dialogue Forum of [the University]” (Kugler & Coleman, 2020)
