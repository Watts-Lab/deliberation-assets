## What you’ll do

You and your partner will be asked to adopt a shared goal for the conversation: to explore **possible ways forward on this issue** that you both could live with.

This might include:

- a compromise you both find acceptable
- a small policy adjustment or variation
- a practical idea that reduces conflict, even if it isn’t perfect for either side

You don’t need to come up with a complete solution; the goal is to explore possibilities rather than to resolve the issue fully.

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Beginning with a shared goal gives both partners the same starting point for the discussion.

Treating the conversation as a joint problem-solving effort encourages you to explore a variety of options that you both could live with.

## What to expect

At the beginning of the conversation, we’ll ask you and your partner to commit to this goal: to focus on possible ways forward on this issue.

After that, you’ll continue with a normal discussion of the topic.
