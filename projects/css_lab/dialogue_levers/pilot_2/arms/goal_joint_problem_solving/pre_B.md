## What you’ll do

At the start of the conversation, we’ll ask you and your partner to treat this as a joint problem-solving exercise: see if you can find a constructive way forward on this issue that both of you could live with.

This might include:

- a compromise you both find acceptable
- a small policy adjustment or variation
- a practical idea that reduces conflict, even if it isn’t perfect for either side

## Why it helps

When people disagree, it’s easy to slip into into correcting, debating, or trying to persuade. Committing to joint problem-solving can make the discussion feel more constructive, lower defensiveness, and highlight options neither of you might have noticed on your own.

## What to expect

Right at the beginning of the conversation, you’ll be asked to confirm this shared goal with your partner.

After that, you’ll continue with a normal discussion of the topic.
