# Reflect and Share: Collecting Thoughts

Participants are asked to take a few minutes before the conversation to organize their thoughts about the assigned topic. This brief reflective period is designed to help participants clarify their own perspective before engaging with their partner. The goal is to reduce cognitive load during the exchange and promote active listening by minimizing the need to gather thoughts while the other person is speaking. Preparing thoughts in advance is theorized to help participants listen to one another instead of thinking about what they are going to say 22. In this operationalization, we intentionally refrain from telling them what type of thoughts to write (e.g. stories, values, etc) to help separate the effect of (e.g.) writing about values from the effect of writing at all.

## Operalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

"Give your participants a moment to reflect on the question. Encourage them to take notes about what they want to share when it's their turn to respond." 22
"partners got pencil and paper and had 3 minutes to prepare the discussion independently from each other." 23
