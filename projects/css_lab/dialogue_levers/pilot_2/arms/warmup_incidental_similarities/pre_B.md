## What you’ll do

At the start of the conversation, you and your partner will spend a few minutes **looking for three unexpected things you have in common** that are unrelated to the discussion topic.

These can be about anything: your background, hobbies, habits, personal experiences, etc.

## Why we are asking you to do this

Finding small, unexpected similarities can remind us how much people tend to have in common, even when they come from different backgrounds or see things differently.

These shared points can give you something familiar to build on as the conversation begins.

## What to expect

At the beginning of the conversation, you’ll have 3–4 minutes to identify shared commonalities.

After that, you’ll move into a normal discussion of the topic.
