## What you’ll do

At the start of the conversation, we will ask you and your partner to set a shared goal: **to describe the main ways your views differ** — clearly, accurately, and fairly.
You won’t be trying to resolve the disagreement. The goal is simply to identify it so you both understand where the real differences lie.

## Why this helps

When people disagree, it can be tempting to avoid uncomfortable differences and focus only on common ground.

But naming the disagreement directly can:

- keep you from talking past each other
- make the conversation feel clearer and more grounded
- create space for deeper engagement

## What to expect

Right at the beginning of the conversation, you’ll be asked to confirm this shared goal with your partner.
After that, you’ll continue with a normal discussion of the topic.
