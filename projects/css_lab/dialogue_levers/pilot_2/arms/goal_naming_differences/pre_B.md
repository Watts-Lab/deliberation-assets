## What you’ll do

You and your partner will be asked to adopt a shared goal for the conversation: **to discover the main ways your views differ**, and describe those differences clearly and fairly.

You won’t be trying to resolve the disagreement. The goal is simply to make the differences explicit, so you both understand where your views diverge.

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Beginning with a shared goal gives both partners the same starting point for the discussion.

When the goal is to identify the differences between your views, both partners can focus on describing the disagreement itself—without needing to resolve it.

## What to expect

At the beginning of the conversation, we’ll ask you and your partner to commit to this goal: to describe how your views differ, clearly and fairly.

After that, you’ll continue with a normal discussion of the topic.
