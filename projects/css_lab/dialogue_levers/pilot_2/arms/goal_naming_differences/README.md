# Instructions: Goal Setting - Naming Differences

Participants are asked to explicitly and respectfully articulate the core of their disagreement. Rather than looking for common ground, or trying to minimize uncomfortable feelings, this intervention leans into the tension to identify where exactly a divergence lies. When executed well, naming areas of disagreement may help avoid talking past each other, make differences concrete and bounded, and pave the way for deeper engagement.

## Operationalizations in the academic and practitioner literature:

- "Naming Differences is a key mediation tool, and it means capturing the crux of differences between two or more parties, and capturing how each person relates to that difference accurately and without distortion. We want to get to the point that, if both parties were here, they would say, "Yes, that’s the heart of the difference between us. And you get me in relation to that difference… the strongest way to disarm the potentially destructive charge of differences is to name them clearly and directly – so long as we are able to capture the way each party relates to the difference as they see it." (Purple: America, We Need to Talk - Film Discussion Guide, 2020)
- "The goal is clarification of viewpoints and understanding of differences, along with discovering whether there are any areas of agreement."(Braver Angels, 2021)
- Phase: “Exploring Differences and Commonalities in Experience”. Description: Awareness creation of the different views and experiences of the participants. Facilitator's Role: Encourage listening to and understanding of the other’s point of view and experiences. Example: Exercises that put the participants in the shoes of their fellow participants."(Search for Common Ground, 2017)
- “Have you heard something you disagreed with? If so, first check to see if you understood it correctly. Then say what was unsettling to you about what you heard and why.”(Herzig & Chasin, 2006)
- "in the differences-focus condition, they were instructed to discuss aspects of their tasks, which was the only difference between the groups” (Saguy et al., 2009)
