## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a moment to reflect on the values and commitments that guide you in your life.

Choose **one** of the following questions and **write your thoughts** in the box below:

- What sense of purpose, mission, or duty guides you in your life?
- What are the most important values you try to uphold every day?
- At the end of your life, how would you hope people describe who you are?

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Reflecting on your personal values can help you decide how you want to approach the conversation and what principles you want to uphold as you talk.

## What to expect

You will be invited to share these thoughts during the conversation, and you can refer to your notes if you find it helpful.
