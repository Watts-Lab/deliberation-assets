Choose **one** of the following questions and **write your thoughts** in the box below:

- What sense of purpose, mission, or duty guides you in your life?
- What are the most important values you try to uphold every day?
- At the end of your life, how would you hope people describe who you are?

## Why it helps

Bringing your core values to mind can help you enter the discussion with a clearer sense of who you are and what matters most to you.

## What to expect

You will be invited to share these thoughts during the conversation, and you can refer to your notes if you find it helpful.
