## Reflect and Share: General Values

Before discussing the focal issue, participants are asked to reflect on broad questions about their hopes, sense of purpose, and personal values. The goal is to bring to mind each person’s guiding principles and identity commitments before entering a potentially difficult conversation. Affirming personal values may buffer an individual’s sense of self worth in the presence of conflicting ideas and enable them to evaluate these ideas without defensiveness 8,35, and additionally, increasing the salience of shared values and identities may reduce the sense of difference from the discussion partner 36,37.

## Operationalizations:

- "Each participant can take 1-2 minutes to answer one of these questions: What are your hopes and concerns for your family, and/or community? What would your best friend say about who you are? What sense of purpose/mission/duty guides you in your life?" 2
- "First, it’s important to make sure the values or morals you believe others have aren’t based on your own assumptions or stereotypes. You can do this by asking questions like, “What are important values that you try to uphold in your life?” and “Who taught you those values, or what experiences formed those values for you?” 27
- "Rather than start with “how are we different” start with “what are our shared core values... Avoid talking positions until you get to know each other and can figure out what makes your partner tick.” 38
