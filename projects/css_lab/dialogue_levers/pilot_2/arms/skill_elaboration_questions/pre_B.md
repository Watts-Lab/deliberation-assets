## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a moment to practice a communication technique—asking **“tell-me-more” questions**—that you can use if you notice yourself reacting strongly to something your partner says.

Even in good conversations, a comment can land the wrong way and make you want to jump in quickly to defend your view.

A different strategy is to invite your partner to **say more about what they meant before you respond.**

Use simple, open-ended invitations that ask your partner to expand or clarify what they have said. For example:

- “Can you tell me more about that?”
- “What does that mean to you?”
- “Can you walk me through an example?”
- “Say more.”

## Why we’re asking you to do this

If something your partner says sparks a strong reaction, a brief “tell-me-more” question can give you a moment to think before responding.

It also helps make sure you respond to what your partner actually meant, rather than react to a hasty assumption.

## Practice:

Try writing “tell-me-more questions” to ask after each of the following statements:
