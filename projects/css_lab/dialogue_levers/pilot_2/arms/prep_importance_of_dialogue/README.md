# Reflect and Share: Importance of Dialogue

Before engaging with the substantive issue, participants are invited to reflect on why it is important to talk about this topic with people who disagree. This meta-conversational reflection is intended to prime a shared commitment to taking the interaction seriously, to mutual respect, and to the possibility of learning from disagreement.

## Operationalizations:

- "Share your name, where you live, and what drew you here."2
- "How can Americans who disagree about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict do a better job of managing these difficult conversations?" 26
- "Ask: Why engage with people with whom we disagree? What’s lost – personally and societally – if we remain in our ideological bubbles? What do you see the characters getting out of being in dialogue with each other?" 12
- "What can each of us do individually, what can our side do, and what might both sides do together to promote better understanding of difference and search for common ground?"46
