## What you’ll do

At the start of the conversation, each of you will take **about 2 minutes** to share your views on the topic while the other listens **without interrupting**.

You will **keep track of your own time**. You can use your watch, phone or computer clock.

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Beginning with an uninterrupted speaking turn gives you a chance to share your perspective fully before the conversation opens up.

As a listener, setting aside 2 minutes for your partner to share means you can listen without needing to respond right away.

## What to expect

At the beginning of the call, you’ll take turns speaking for about 2 minutes each.

Once both of you have shared, you’ll continue with a normal back-and-forth conversation about the topic.
