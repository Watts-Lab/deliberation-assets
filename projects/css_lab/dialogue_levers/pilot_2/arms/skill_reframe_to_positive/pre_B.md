## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a moment to practice a communication technique—called **reframing to the positive**—that can be useful when you find yourself focusing on what you _don’t_ want, _can’t_ do, or want to move _away_ from.

Positive framing flips the conversation to focus on what you value, what might be possible, and what you want to move toward.

How to reframe a statement to the positive:

1. Notice when your statement is framed around **what you don’t want** (e.g., with words like stop, can’t, shouldn’t).
2. Ask yourself **what value or outcome matters** to you underneath that concern.
3. Rephrase your thought **around the positive value**.

For example:

> “People shouldn’t interrupt.” → “Everyone should have a chance to finish their thought.”

> “That’ll never work.” → “There’s a key challenge we’d need to solve.”

> “Stop getting distracted.” → “Focus on what we’re doing.”

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Positive framing highlights what is possible and worth moving toward without casting judgment on others.

It helps shift conversations from opposition toward problem-solving.

## Practice:
