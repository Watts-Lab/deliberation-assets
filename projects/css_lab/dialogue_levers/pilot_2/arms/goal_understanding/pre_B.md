## What you’ll do

You and your partner will be asked to adopt a shared goal for the conversation: to try to **understand each other’s views**—what they think and why—without trying to change their mind.

## Why we are asking you to do this

Beginning with a shared goal gives both partners the same starting point for the discussion.

When the focus is on understanding one another, both partners can participate fully without anyone needing to change their mind.

### What to expect

At the beginning of the conversation, we’ll ask you and your partner to commit to this goal: to focus on understanding one another’s views, rather than trying to change one another’s minds.

After that, you’ll continue with a normal discussion of the topic.
