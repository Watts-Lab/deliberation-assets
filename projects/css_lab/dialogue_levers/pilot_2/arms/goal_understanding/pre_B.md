## What you’ll do

At the start of the conversation, we’ll ask you and your partner to set a shared goal: to try to **understand each other’s views**—what they think and why—without trying to change their mind.

## Why it helps

When people disagree, it’s easy to slip into into correcting, debating, or trying to persuade. Agreeing in advance to make understanding your goal can help both of you listen with more curiosity and create a more constructive exchange.

### What to expect

Right at the beginning of the conversation, you’ll be asked to confirm this shared goal with your partner.

After that, you’ll continue with a normal discussion of the topic.
