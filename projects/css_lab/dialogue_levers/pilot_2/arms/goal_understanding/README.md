# Instructions: Goal Setting - Understanding

Before the conversation begins, participants are asked to commit to a goal of understanding their partner’s perspective rather than persuading or winning. They then complete comprehension checks to reinforce this goal and the expectation that their partner will do the same. By making this goal explicit, the intervention aims to shift motivational orientation from debate/defense toward curiosity, listening, and learning. Emphasizing that this is a shared goal promotes openness and a more positive conversational experience. 50

## Operationalizations in the practitioner literature:

- "Goals: Gain more understanding of the experiences, feelings, and beliefs of someone who differs with you in today’s politically polarized environment. ... We’re here to explain our views and to understand the other person, not to convince the other person to change their mind."1
- "Be curious and listen to understand… You might enjoy exploring how others’ experiences have shaped their values and perspectives." 2
- "Listen with Curiosity Not Judgment: It’s very easy to listen for flaws in someone’s arguments so you can correct them and demonstrate that they are wrong and you are right. Instead, think like an investigator. “Tell me more about that.” “How long have you felt this way?” “Is there something you’ve experienced personally that makes you think that way?” 51
- "The purpose is not to persuade or convince others that you’re right and they’re wrong. This dialogue will be about discovering not just WHAT others think, but WHY" 3
- "Start by setting clear goals for yourself. Ask yourself: “What outcome am I hoping for?” and “Am I trying to build understanding with this person or simply express my feelings?” Clarifying your own goals helps steer the conversation toward sharing rather than misunderstandings or heated arguments." 52
- "The purpose of dialogue is to motivate people or community members to work toward a common vision, understanding, or solution to a specific issue of concern."6
- "participants in dialogue often explicitly agree to set aside persuasion and debate so that they can focus on mutual understanding."29
