# Reflect and Share: Topic-specific Values

Participants are asked to reflect on the values, commitments, or moral principles that underlie their opinion on the assigned topic. The goal is to prompt participants to articulate why they hold their beliefs, and what deeper values or life commitments inform that belief. By making the moral foundations of conflicting beliefs explicit in their conversations, participants may come to realize that their differences stem from legitimate values emphasized to different degrees 32, and help them understand each position in the light of other deeply-held beliefs 33,34.

- "What values and concerns do you bring to your views on [the topic]... Focus on what core values are at stake for you... "26
