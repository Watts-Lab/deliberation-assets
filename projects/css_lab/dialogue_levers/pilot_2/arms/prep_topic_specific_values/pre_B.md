## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a few minutes to reflect on the **core values and moral commitments** that shape your beliefs on this issue.

These might include:

- moral values (e.g., fairness, care, freedom, responsibility)
- personal commitments or life principles you try to uphold
- aspects of your personal or family identity
- elements of your faith or philosophical outlook

Please **write about the values** that feel most important in the box below.

## Why it helps

Knowing the values behind your beliefs makes it easier to explain where you’re coming from — and helps your partner understand your perspective, even if they disagree.

## What to expect

You will be invited to share these thoughts during the conversation, and you can refer to your notes if you find it helpful.
