At the start of the conversation, each of you will **spend 2 minutes describing your views** on the topic.

- During this time, your partner should **listen without interrupting**.
- You will each keep track of your own time.

After both of you have shared for 2 minutes, you will continue with a normal back-and-forth conversation about the topic.
