## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a moment to practice a communication technique—called **hedging**—that can help you express a perspective your partner may not share.

Hedging means softening your statements to show openness instead of certainty. You can do this in several ways:

### 1. Speak from your own perspective

Acknowledge that your view reflects only what you have experienced or learned.

> “He did it on purpose.” → “From the outside, it looks like he did it on purpose.”

### 2. Own your opinions

Turn general claims into personal ones. Speak for yourself, not for everyone.

> “Dogs are better than cats.” → “I prefer dogs to cats.”

### 3. Avoid absolutes

Replace “always” or “never” with less more accurate language.

> “The bus is never on time.” → “The bus has been late a lot recently.”

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Hedging lets you express what you think while making clear that you are speaking from your own experience.

It lets you convey your perspective without turning it into a claim your partner has to accept or reject.

## Practice:

Try re-writing these statements using any of the hedging strategies above.
