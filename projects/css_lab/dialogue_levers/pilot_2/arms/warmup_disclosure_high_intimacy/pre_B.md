## What you'll do

At the start of the conversation, you and your partner will each **answer one question that is unrelated to the assigned topic** from the list below:

- When was a time that was really difficult for you or when you were especially upset?
- Who are you closest to in your family? What is that relationship like?
- What do you like best about your life? Least?

Feel free to share as much or as little as you are comfortable with.

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Beginning with a deeper warmup question gives you a chance to talk about the more personal parts of your life and establish a meaningful connection before turning to the main topic.

## What to expect

At the beginning of the call, you’ll each pick **one** of the warm-up questions to answer.

After about 3–4 minutes, you’ll shift into a normal back-and-forth conversation about the assigned topic.
