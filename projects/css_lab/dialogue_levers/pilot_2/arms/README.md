Each folder will always have files for:

- mid_A.md - text that goes before the topic during the conversation
- mid_B.md - text that goes after the topic during conversation

there will probably also be:

- pre_A.md - text that goes before the topic in the pre-conversation intervention
- pre_B.md - text that goes after the topic in the pre-conversation intervention

Plus comprehension checks as defined by the treatment.

## **Reflect and Share: Collecting Thoughts**

Participants are asked to take a few minutes before the conversation to organize their thoughts about the assigned topic. This brief reflective period is designed to help participants clarify their own perspective before engaging with their partner. The goal is to reduce cognitive load during the exchange and promote active listening by minimizing the need to gather thoughts while the other person is speaking. Preparing thoughts in advance is theorized to help participants listen to one another instead of thinking about what they are going to say [(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD). In this operationalization, we intentionally refrain from telling them what type of thoughts to write (e.g. stories, values, etc) to help separate the effect of (e.g.) writing about values from the effect of writing at all.

Operalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

- "Give your participants a moment to reflect on the question. Encourage them to take notes about what they want to share when it's their turn to respond." [(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD)
- "partners got pencil and paper and had 3 minutes to prepare the discussion independently from each other." [(Conradi et al., 2020\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Iqrg)
- “ Encourage them to write down notes about what they are feeling and want to share when it’s their turn to respond” (Herzig, Maggie, and Mitch Chanin. 2024\. “Essential Guide to Dialogues About Israel-Palestine.” Essential Partners. https://pardot.whatisessential.org/l/935913/2024-03-05/b4ny1/935913/1709672802K7yjr0ik/ep\_israel\_palestine\_guide\_2024.pdf.)

**Reflect and Share: Personal Storytelling**

Participants are asked to reflect on and share personal stories that have shaped their beliefs about the discussion topic. The goal is to encourage _narrative self-disclosure_—participants are invited to explain the life experiences, challenges, relationships, or formative moments that have informed their perspective.

Academic research suggests that personal storytelling elicits more active listening and increases feelings of psychological safety in conversations [(Itzchakov et al., 2016\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/jbWp), and leads to greater respect for contrasting opinions [(Kubin et al., 2021\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/2LiT) and willingness to engage with disliked groups [(Santoro et al., 2025; Wojcieszak & Kim, 2016\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/9ByF+MQWu).

Operationalizations in academic and practitioner literature:

- "What life experiences have influenced how you approach…" [(Braver Angels, 2024a)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/MbJZ)
- "Share something from your life experience that informs your response to or position on…" [(Living Room Conversations, 2025\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kqwt)
- "What experiences have led you to believe what you believe about…" [(Constructive Dialog Institute, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/okV2)
- "What personal life experiences shaped the values that inform your current views or feelings about… Could you tell us something about one or two of these events or experiences", “Ask them to tell you about a life experience or person who shaped their values or perspective in that way. Sharing personal stories has been proven to build empathy and understanding, even across deep differences.” [(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD)
- "Can you concretize that? Is there a specific example or a direct experience you’ve had that illustrates what you’re saying more concretely?” [(Purple: America, We Need to Talk \- Film Discussion Guide, 2020\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/bqTF)
- "Share a story from your life that shaped how you see…"[(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD)
- “How did you develop this belief?” or “Who impacted the way you see the world the most in your life?” These questions help them focus on the reasons behind their views, which builds more understanding and deeper relationships with those with whom we disagree." [(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/O2gh)
- “talk about a meaningful event \[you\] have experienced…” [(Itzchakov et al., 2016\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/jbWp)
- “If you feel very strongly about an issue, saying something about what life experiences have led to you to be passionate about it. Stories humanize issues and make passionate political people come across as human beings who care.” [(Braver Angels 2018\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Zz2m)

**Reflect and Share: Hopes and Fears**

Participants are asked to reflect on and share their _hopes and fears_ related to the assigned topic. The aim is to surface the emotions, aspirations, and concerns that underlie participants’ views, and to help them thing toward the future rather than the past.

Operationalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

- “What are your hopes and aspirations for our country?” [(Braver Angels, 2024b)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/KUb6)
- "Thirty years from now, what story would you like to be able to tell about...” [(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD)
- "What do you hope for most when it comes to this issue or policy? What do you worry about most when it comes to this issue or policy?" [(Constructive Dialog Institute, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/okV2)
- "What hopes, concerns and values do you have that underlie your beliefs?" [(Herzig & Sarrouf, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/JP9y)

**Reflect and Share: Topic-specific Values**

Participants are asked to reflect on the values, commitments, or moral principles that underlie their opinion on the assigned topic. The goal is to prompt participants to articulate _why_ they hold their beliefs, and what deeper values or life commitments inform that belief. By making the moral foundations of conflicting beliefs explicit in their conversations, participants may come to realize that their differences stem from legitimate values emphasized to different degrees [(Graham et al., 2009\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kiuH), and help them understand each position in the light of other deeply-held beliefs [(Feinberg & Willer, 2015; Voelkel & Feinberg, 2018\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/vY5h+Z2MW).

Operationalizations:

- "What values or personal commitments come to mind when you think about why you hold this belief?"[(Constructive Dialog Institute, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/okV2)
- "...how you see your personal faith connect—or not connect—with your perspective on \[the topic\]... What personal value is at the heart of your faith life around issues of..." [(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD)
- "What values and concerns do you bring to your views on \[the topic\]... Focus on what core values are at stake for you... "[(Braver Angels, 2024a)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/MbJZ)

- > aspects of your cultural or family identity

- > elements of your faith or philosophical outlook

  > Please **write about the values** that feel most important in the box below.

  > **Why we’re asking you to do this** Writing about the values behind your beliefs can help you to explain the principles that you think are most important when considering this issue.

**Reflect and Share: General Values**

Before discussing the focal issue, participants are asked to reflect on broad questions about their hopes, sense of purpose, and personal values. The goal is to bring to mind each person’s guiding principles and identity commitments before entering a potentially difficult conversation. Affirming personal values may buffer an individual’s sense of self worth in the presence of conflicting ideas and enable them to evaluate these ideas without defensiveness [(Argyle & Freeze, 2024; Correll et al., 2004\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/P07U+lDxs), and additionally, increasing the salience of shared values and identities may reduce the sense of difference from the discussion partner [(Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000; Levendusky, 2018\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/81Xt+gIKI). General values will apply not just to your attitude on the topic, but to how you want to present yourself and behave during the conversation.

Operationalizations:

- "Each participant can take 1-2 minutes to answer one of these questions: What are your hopes and concerns for your family, and/or community? What would your best friend say about who you are? What sense of purpose/mission/duty guides you in your life?" [(Living Room Conversations, 2025\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kqwt)
- "First, it’s important to make sure the values or morals you believe others have aren’t based on your own assumptions or stereotypes. You can do this by asking questions like, “What are important values that you try to uphold in your life?” and “Who taught you those values, or what experiences formed those values for you?” [(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/O2gh)
- "Rather than start with “how are we different” start with “what are our shared core values... Avoid talking positions until you get to know each other and can figure out what makes your partner tick.” [(Listen First Project, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/2HCJ)

**Reflect and Share: Addressing Stereotypes**

Participants are asked to reflect on common stereotypes or misperceptions about people who share their views and describe how they would want others to understand them more fully. The goal is to help participants see those who disagree as more complex than the caricature they are often presented with, and see their discussion partner as an individual rather than as a member of a nebulous group. These interventions may improve outgroup affect [(Voelkel et al., 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/hKHs)

Operationalizations

- “...generate, discuss, and report back on the most common false stereotypes or misconceptions of their side, why these stereotypes are inaccurate, what is true instead, and whether there is a kernel of truth in the stereotype.” [(Braver Angels, 2023\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/47Rr)
- "Have you ever felt stereotyped by those who hold different views on this issue? If so, how? Which of these stereotypes was most painful to you? Most inaccurate? Why?" [(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD)
- "What’s a common misconception or stereotype people on the outside have about you because of the groups (e.g., race, faith, or gender) you belong to? ... What’s something about you that challenges this stereotype?” [(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/O2gh)
- "Please reflect for a moment on situations in which you have felt stereotyped by people who have different views or perspectives. Please make a list of 5-6 stereotypes, not worrying for the moment about how much truth (if any) there is in those stereotypes. As a \_\_\_\_ I think that I am viewed by\_\_\_\_\_ as having these characteristics, beliefs or intentions:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Which one stereotype would you find to be most painful or offensive if someone applied it to you? Are there stereotypes on your list that you marked as particularly inaccurate that you’d like to speak about, again, indicating how you know yourself to be different from what these stereotypes would suggest about you?" [(Herzig & Chasin, 2006\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/8Efw)
- "...correcting exaggerated stereotypes of out-partisans. This strategy is illustrated by correcting democracy misperceptions which presented participants with survey data correcting partisans’ inflated perceptions of levels of support for undemocratic practices among outpartisans.”[(Voelkel et al., 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/hKHs)
- "Participants then engaged in a stereotype activity designed to illuminate stereotypes that are held by each group about the other group… This involved generating lists of stereotypes about one’s own group, labeling them as painful, inaccurate, or understandable, and then a facilitated dialogue about this activity." [(Dessel, 2010\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/ztnz)

**Reflect and Share: Importance of Dialogue**

Before engaging with the substantive issue, participants are invited to reflect on why it is important to talk about this topic with people who disagree. This meta-conversational reflection is intended to prime a shared commitment to taking the interaction seriously, to mutual respect, and to the possibility of learning from disagreement.

Operationalizations:

- "Share your name, where you live, and what drew you here."[(Living Room Conversations, 2025\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kqwt)

> **Step 2**: Please have a conversation about the following topic: \<Topic\>

**Reflect and Share: Open-ended Questions**

Participants are asked to write several open-ended questions for their partner before the conversation begins. The goal is to encourage curiosity and genuine interest in the partner’s perspective, and help participants engage more deeply with the topic. Question asking may improve perceptions of the asker, create more open-minded behavior, and lead to more willingness to engage with the discussion partner [(Chen et al., 2010\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/D1AL).

Operationalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

- "What questions do you have for someone who holds the opposite viewpoint?"[(Constructive Dialog Institute, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/okV2)
- "...formulate four questions of curiosity. …after your group finalizes your questions you can write down the final list of questions… Good Questions are Informative: You would learn something about the other side, something you are curious about (as opposed to a question you want them to ‘learn from,’ as in seeing their ignorance or their internal contradictions). Good Questions are Answerable: It’s a question they can actually answer. Avoid being so technical or policy wonkish that regular people would be stumped. Good Questions are Straightforward: It’s straightforward, without carrying an assumption that the other side might dispute and then not really get to the question…" [(Braver Angels, 2023\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/47Rr)
- "come up with three open-ended questions for the speaker that will help you better understand why \[your partner\] feels as he does.” [(Chen et al., 2010\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/D1AL)
- "During the conversation, please ask your partner at least 9 questions. In other words, do not ask your partner less than 9 questions. (Please DO NOT tell your partner that you were given these instructions.)" [(Huang et al., 2017\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/iCal)

**Instructions: Goal Setting \- Understanding**

Before the conversation begins, participants are asked to commit to a goal of _understanding their partner’s perspective_ rather than persuading or winning. They then complete comprehension checks to reinforce this goal and the expectation that their partner will do the same. By making this goal explicit, the intervention aims to shift motivational orientation from debate/defense toward curiosity, listening, and learning. Emphasizing that this is a shared goal promotes openness and a more positive conversational experience. [(Collins et al., 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Mkqs) Behaviorally, this is expected to activate a clarification/inquiry mechanism focused on beliefs in general \- areas of agreement and disagreement.

Operationalizations in the practitioner literature:

- "Goals: Gain more understanding of the experiences, feelings, and beliefs of someone who differs with you in today’s politically polarized environment. ... We’re here to explain our views and to understand the other person, not to convince the other person to change their mind."[(Braver Angels, 2024b)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/KUb6)
- "Be curious and listen to understand… You might enjoy exploring how others’ experiences have shaped their values and perspectives." [(Living Room Conversations, 2025\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kqwt)
- "Listen with Curiosity Not Judgment: It’s very easy to listen for flaws in someone’s arguments so you can correct them and demonstrate that they are wrong and you are right. Instead, think like an investigator. “Tell me more about that.” “How long have you felt this way?” “Is there something you’ve experienced personally that makes you think that way?” [(Represent.us, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/l1oN)
- "The purpose is not to persuade or convince others that you’re right and they’re wrong. This dialogue will be about discovering not just WHAT others think, but WHY" [(Constructive Dialog Institute, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/okV2)
- "Start by setting clear goals for yourself. Ask yourself: “What outcome am I hoping for?” and “Am I trying to build understanding with this person or simply express my feelings?” Clarifying your own goals helps steer the conversation toward sharing rather than misunderstandings or heated arguments." [(Duhigg, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kZ5Z)
- "The purpose of dialogue is to motivate people or community members to work toward a common vision, understanding, or solution to a specific issue of concern."[(Search for Common Ground, 2017\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/CWBU)
- "participants in dialogue often explicitly agree to set aside persuasion and debate so that they can focus on mutual understanding."[(Herzig & Chasin, 2006\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/8Efw)

**Instructions: Goal Setting \- Joint Problem Solving**

Before the conversation begins, participants are asked to commit to a goal of jointly developing a concrete, mutually acceptable way forward on the issue — a compromise, adjustment, or policy variation that acknowledges both perspectives. This intervention focuses on collaborative problem-solving: moving beyond argument to propose constructive possibilities that could reduce tension or address shared concerns, even if participants ultimately still disagree.

Operationalization in the academic and practitioner literatures:

- "Best practice is where the community is involved at the beginning of the process in setting the priorities and coming up with solutions." [(Bastiaensen & Cook, 2021\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/VeoA)
- "People often agree on the issues affecting their communities, and have similar ideas for the solutions to those problems, yet they still feel like they’re at odds with one another based on their social or cultural identities… focusing on solutions instead of identities can make those conversations less charged and create a deeper sense of unity, as people appreciate the actual agreements they have."[(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/O2gh)
- “It’s important to me that we work together and find a plan everyone can live with.”[(Duhigg, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kZ5Z)
- "\[participants\] were asked to engage in a discussion on the issue for about twenty minutes and prepare a joint statement. The quality of the joint position statement was used to determine the degree of tractability of each conflict (i.e., outcome measures)." [(Kurt et al., 2014\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/CqF4)
- "each dyad discussed a moral issue… and tried to reach consensus by writing a joint position statement on which they both agreed and with which they felt comfortable. They were informed that the statement was to be shared anonymously with a “Dialogue Forum of \[the University\]” [(Kugler & Coleman, 2020\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/MuMe)

**Instructions: Goal Setting \- Naming Differences**

Participants are asked to explicitly and respectfully articulate the core of their disagreement. Rather than looking for common ground, or trying to minimize uncomfortable feelings, this intervention leans into the tension to identify where exactly a divergence lies. When executed well, naming areas of disagreement may help avoid talking past each other, make differences concrete and bounded, and pave the way for deeper engagement. Behaviorally, this is expected to activate a clarification/mapping mechanism focused specifically on areas of disagreement.

Operationalizations in the academic and practitioner literature:

- "Naming Differences is a key mediation tool, and it means capturing the crux of differences between two or more parties, and capturing how each person relates to that difference accurately and without distortion. We want to get to the point that, if both parties were here, they would say, "Yes, that’s the heart of the difference between us. And you get me in relation to that difference… the strongest way to disarm the potentially destructive charge of differences is to name them clearly and directly – so long as we are able to capture the way each party relates to the difference as they see it." [(Purple: America, We Need to Talk \- Film Discussion Guide, 2020\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/bqTF)
- "The goal is clarification of viewpoints and understanding of differences, along with discovering whether there are any areas of agreement."[(Braver Angels, 2021\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/cQq8)
- Phase: “Exploring Differences and Commonalities in Experience”. Description: Awareness creation of the different views and experiences of the participants. Facilitator's Role: Encourage listening to and understanding of the other’s point of view and experiences. Example: Exercises that put the participants in the shoes of their fellow participants."[(Search for Common Ground, 2017\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/CWBU)
- “Have you heard something you disagreed with? If so, first check to see if you understood it correctly. Then say what was unsettling to you about what you heard and why.”[(Herzig & Chasin, 2006\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/8Efw)
- "in the differences-focus condition, they were instructed to discuss aspects of their tasks, which was the only difference between the groups” [(Saguy et al., 2009\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/EaDu)

**Instructions: Goal Setting \- Find common ground**

Participants are asked to orient their conversation toward _identifying meaningful common ground_ between their views and their partner’s. They are encouraged to pause and listen for shared values, concerns, or goals—even if their detailed opinions diverge. This is expected to activate a clarification/inquiry mechanism focused on areas of agreement.

Operationalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

- "What is one surprising commonality or one surprising difference you discovered between yourself and someone else here?"[(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD)
- "Find Places of Agreement It’s easy to find places where you disagree, but try to shift that mindset to “what is this person saying that I DO agree with?” even if it is a small, tangential piece of their argument. “Well, I certainly agree that we don’t want to make it easy for terrorists to get into our country undetected” Try to be specific about a particular point the other person raised, but you can always go more general, “well, I agree with you that the current immigration system is a mess and should be addressed in a comprehensive way”[(Represent.us, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/l1oN)

**Instructions: Warmup \- Co-creating Ground Rules**

At the start of the conversation, participants are asked to collaboratively establish a few “ground rules” to guide their interaction (e.g., no interruptions, assume good faith, share the floor). The goal is to set shared expectations for conduct, promote mutual accountability, and align participants around constructive norms before engaging in disagreement. Establishing such rules together can reduce defensiveness and encourage balanced participation. This intervention is specifically about the act of co-creating rules rather than having them provided.

Operationalizations from the practitioner literature:

- "Start by establishing some basic ground rules. For instance, you might say, “Let’s avoid interruptions,” or, “Let’s keep everything we discuss today confidential.” These types of agreements help reduce defensiveness and keep a discussion constructive. [(Duhigg, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kZ5Z)
- "Communication agreements are general rules for the way people will interact during the dialogue. You might propose a set of agreements like the one below, or you might co-create them with your participants… If you can’t do that, you might invite participants to adjust or add to the basic set of agreements listed below." [(Herzig & Chanin, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/eHkO)
- "What agreements could we have that would make you more likely to share, rather than withhold, \[a contrary\] idea?” [(Essential Partners, 2019\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/hhys)
- "Before starting the conversation itself, suggest a list of norms and get students’ input on what they’d like to add, change, or remove from the list."[(Constructive Dialog Institute, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/okV2)

**Instructions: Warmup \- Finding Incidental Similarities**

Participants begin by identifying three uncommon things they have in common with one another—shared traits, experiences, or interests that they do not share with most people. This brief exercise is designed to prime a sense of similarity and shared identity before turning to potentially divisive topics. Research on cross-cutting exposure and shared identity shows that discovering nonpolitical commonalities with people who differ in political views can reduce polarization and increase openness during subsequent discussion [(Balietti et al., 2021\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Lw6B) and activating inclusive social categorization (“we”) decreases bias and fosters cooperation [(Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/81Xt).

Operationalizations in practitioner literature:

- "Identifying Commonalities and Differences: Task people in the small group with identifying at least five things that they all have in common (for example: places they have visited, movies they love, items of clothing they own). Then have each person identify at least two things they do not have in common with anyone else in their small group." [(Tropp & Dehrone, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/f6ot)
- "Even when someone seems different from you, chances are you can find at least one important identity you have in common—it could be a group you both belong to (you’re both Midwesterners) or a role you share (you’re both parents). Often those shared identities are bigger and more significant than our differences. For instance, you might root for different soccer teams, but you’re both soccer fans. Instead of focusing on the differences, try to find those important threads of similarity." [(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/O2gh)
- "Pairs race to find 5 things in common faster than others" [(Constructive Dialog Institute, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/okV2)

**Instructions: Warmup \- Low-intimacy Disclosure**

Participants are invited to share a brief, low-intimacy personal detail before beginning the main conversation. Each person chooses one of several light, everyday questions to answer in such a way that allows the development of a relationship before discussing more difficult topics. This warm-start is intended to ease participants into the interaction, reduce initial tension, and create a sense of human connection before discussing a disagreement. In everyday life, people often begin conversations with light personal disclosure (“small talk”)[(Guydish & Fox Tree, 2025\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/mke7), which may increase enjoyment, reduce discomfort, and build rapport before tackling more sensitive topics[(Altman & Taylor, 1973\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/q5Hd).

Operationalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

- "Share something about yourself such as where you live and for how long, family, and if you like, a fun question: What was your favorite meal as a child?" [(Braver Angels, 2021\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/cQq8)
- "Share your name, where you live, and what drew you here." [(Living Room Conversations, 2025\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kqwt)
- "Ask people to come up with two or three things they know how to do that other people often don’t know how to do… Ask each person to describe a dish or kitchen smell that reminds them of home.” [(Tropp & Dehrone, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/f6ot)
- "Choose \[to share\] one of these: Something you had to leave behind to be here tonight (for example, a task undone, a baseball game, a child wanting help with a science project). Something about yourself that you’d like other people to know and that doesn’t relate to \[the topic\]. It could be about work, play, passions, or pre-occupations— anything." [(Herzig & Chasin, 2006\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/8Efw)
- "We often see others in terms of their group membership: He’s old, she’s white, they’re immigrants. But according to research, when we view people in terms of their own individual tastes and preferences, we feel less threatened by those who might seem “not like us… ask yourself questions about that person’s particular tastes and preferences." [(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/O2gh)
- "...start with an icebreaker or warm-up activity that can help to reduce initial feelings of discomfort and get people from different groups talking and engaging with one another."[(Tropp & Dehrone, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/f6ot)
- “If you could have any one superpower, what would it be and why? If you could meet anyone in the world, who would you want to meet? What do you think would be fun to do with them? What is your favorite kind of music and why? What do you want to be when you grow up? Why? Find three things you two have in common. For example, if you both have similar hobbies, enjoy the same foods or like the same colors. If you could only eat one kind of food for a year, what would it be? How long do you think it would take you to get tired of eating that food? If you could live in the world of a book, movie, or TV show, which fictional world would you choose and why?" [(Swerbenski et al., 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/46Kc)
- "1. When was the last time you walked for more than an hour? Describe where you went and what you saw. 2\. How did you celebrate last Halloween? 3\. Do you like to get up early or stay up late? Why? 4\. What is the best TV show you’ve seen in the last month? Tell your partner about it. 5\. How often do you get your hair cut? Where do you go?

**Instructions: Warmup \- High-intimacy Disclosure**

Participants are asked to share a more personal story or reflection before beginning the main discussion. Each person chooses one prompt inviting emotional or value-laden disclosure (for example, describing a time they felt deeply grateful or recounting an important life event). This activity draws on evidence that meaningful and higher-intimacy self-disclosure is often more successful than expected [(Kardas et al., 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/cgBr), and discussing “deeper” questions leads to more enjoyment and feelings of connection than shallow topics.

Operationalizations in the academic and practitioner literatures:

- “- When was the last time you laughed really, really hard? What was so funny? \- Describe a time that was really difficult for you or when you were especially upset. \- Your house catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why? \- What do you like best about your life? Least? \- Who are you closest to in your family? What is that relationship like? \- Tell your interaction partner something that you like about yourself. Be specific. \- Tell your interaction partner something that you like about them. Be specific." [(Swerbenski et al., 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/46Kc)
- “1. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? Tell the other participant about it. 2\. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, your future, or anything else, what would you want to know? 3\. If you were going to become a close friend with the other participant, please share what would be important for him or her to know. 4\. Can you describe a time you cried in front of another person?" [(Kardas et al., 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/cgBr)
- “- Share with the group one talent you have that you could teach somebody else, and one thing you really would like to learn. \- What is something you see happening in the world that gives you hope? \- Who is someone in your life that you are grateful for lately?"

## **Instructions: Go-Around**

This intervention ensures equal and uninterrupted speaking time for each participant prior to open discussion. Each person takes a fixed amount of time (2 minutes) to present their views without interruption, while the other listens. After both parties have spoken, the conversation proceeds in a more free-form, back-and-forth way.

This format operationalizes _perspective-giving_ (i.e. giving each person a chance to express how they see things), which leads to improved attitudes and relational outcomes in contexts of disagreement or power asymmetry. [(Bruneau & Saxe, 2012\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/naLI). By guaranteeing airtime, the intervention ensures that each person has the opportunity to speak, and helps other participants to listen more deeply. [(Herzig & Chanin, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/eHkO)

Operationalizations in the practitioner literature:

- "Each participant chooses a question below and takes \~2 minutes to answer without interruption or crosstalk. After everyone has answered, the group may take about 10 minutes to explore what you’ve heard from each other before going back to answer another question."[(Living Room Conversations, 2025\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kqwt)
- "(Up to 5 minutes each, no cross talk. Starting at this point, it can be really helpful to set a timer.)" [(Braver Angels, 2024b)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/KUb6)
- "In a go-round, one person speaks at a time for an allotted length of time." [(Herzig & Chanin, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/eHkO)
- "Everyone has 2 minutes to respond in a go-round. During each person’s allotted 2 minutes, they only speak and others only listen. After the go-round is complete and everyone has shared for their 2 minutes, the group can discuss freely." [(Constructive Dialogue Institute, n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Ni6u)
- "Setting up an equal listening time agreement, where each person gets the same amount of time to listen and to be listened to, can be an effective method of practicing and receiving compassionate listening." [(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/O2gh)
- "Offer each person the same amount of time to respond to the question. Be clear about the speaking order. We sometimes call this model Think, Write, Speak. It helps people let go of worrying about what they're going to say and focus on listening deeply to one another."[(Essential Partners, 2022\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/U6pD)
- "A go-round is a highly structured way of speaking and listening. It begins when the facilitator poses a question and then asks the participants to pause and reflect on their responses before anyone speaks. After the pause, going in turn around the circle, each participant either responds to the question or passes. When a go-round has been completed, the facilitator checks with those who passed to see if they would like to have a turn to speak before the group moves on to the next question."[(Herzig & Chasin, 2006\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/8Efw)
- "It’s going to help me bring my best self if we can agree to three simple things: Let’s... share the time, let’s not interrupt each other and no one person goes on too long..."[(Herzig & Sarrouf, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/JP9y)
- "One of you goes first, taking up to 4 minutes, then the other person goes." [(Braver Angels, 2024a)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/MbJZ)
- Go-round where everyone has 1 minute to share about an item that has meaning for them" [(Constructive Dialog Institute, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/okV2)

## **Skill-Building: Hedging Language**

Participants are encouraged to use _hedging language_—phrasing that softens certainty and acknowledges that one’s perspective may be partial. Hedges such as _“It seems to me…”_, _“I might be wrong, but…”_, or _“From my experience…”_ communicate openness to other interpretations and reduce the sense of confrontation. By leaving space for alternative viewpoints, hedging signals respect and epistemic humility. Hedging and “epistemic distancing” [(Conlin & Scherr, 2018\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/fZJc) reduce the risk associated with making a contrary statement, encourage collaborative sensemaking, and increase perceptions of receptiveness [(Yeomans et al., 2020\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/01b2).

Operationalizations in the academic and practitioner literature:

- "Hedge your claims, even when you feel very certain about your beliefs. It signals a recognition that there are some cases or some people who might support your opponent’s perspective." [(Minson, 2023\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/ypUP)
- “Use I-statements (“This is how I see it”) more often than truth-statements (“This is how it is.”)” [(Braver Angels, 2018b)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/KpCM)
- “When sharing our knowledge, we will avoid making sweeping statements or grand pronouncements in favor of statements that connect what we know to particular experiences or sources of information.” [(Herzig & Chasin, 2006\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/8Efw)
- "Using “I’m concerned/worried/troubled” expressions rather than definitive “This is what will happen” statements when referring to the future. [(Braver Angels, 2018a)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Zz2m)
- "We will speak for ourselves rather than on behalf of a group (as “I,” not “we”). This agreement invites the full complexity of personal experiences into a conversation."[(Essential Partners, 2020\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/OX7e)
- "Use “I” statements “This is how I see it” “From the things I’ve read, I come at this a little differently” “I actually have some personal experience in this issue that makes me think....” Note the difference from “That’s not true, here’s what’s actually going on” “You clearly haven’t read what the experts have to say”[(Represent.us, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/l1oN)
- "Use "hedges" to soften your claims. For example, you could say: "X is partly true... " or " Y is sometimes the case" [(Yeomans et al., 2020\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/01b2)

Pre-conversation text:

> In a few minutes, you and your partner will have a conversation about the following assigned topic. Based on your earlier answers, you and your partner see this issue differently.

> \<Topic\>

> **What you’ll do**

> Before joining the call, take a moment to practice a communication technique—called **hedging**—that can help you express a perspective your partner may not share.

> Hedging means softening your statements to show openness instead of certainty. You can do this in several ways:

> **1\. Speak from your own perspective** Acknowledge that your view reflects only what _you_ have experienced or learned. \> “He did it on purpose.” → “From the outside, it looks like he did it on purpose.”

> **2\. Own your opinions** Turn general claims into personal ones. Speak for yourself, not for everyone. \> “Dogs are better than cats.” → “I prefer dogs to cats.”

> **3\. Avoid absolutes** Replace “always” or “never” with less more accurate language.

> \> “The bus is never on time.” → “The bus has been late a lot recently.” **Why we’re asking you to do this**

> Hedging lets you express what you think while making clear that you are speaking from your own experience. It lets you convey your perspective without turning it into a claim your partner has to accept or reject. **Practice:** Try re-writing these statements using any of the hedging strategies above: 1\. Cyclists think traffic laws don’t apply to them. \<response box\> 2\. Broccoli is gross. \<response box\> 3\. The boss never listens to junior employees. \<response box\>

In-conversation text:

> Please have a conversation about the following topic: \<Topic\> Remember to use the **hedging strategies** you practiced: \- Speak from your own perspective (“In my experience…”) \- Own your opinions (“I prefer…”) \- Avoid absolutes (“Sometimes…”)

**Skill-Building: Elaboration questions**

Participants are trained to respond to challenging or ambiguous statements by asking “elaboration questions” before offering their own perspective, rather than reacting, correcting, or rebutting. For example, “Can you tell me more about that?” or “What makes you say that?” Asking elaboration questions slows the reflex to argue, demonstrates receptiveness to the partner’s views [(Chen et al., 2010\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/D1AL), and gives them the space to soften or nuance their own statements.

**Operationalizations in the practitioner and academic literature**

- "Examples of Constructive Questions: What makes you say that? Why is that issue so important to you? Is there a person or experience you’ve had that influenced your belief? Can you say more about what you mean when you say \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_? Why do you think that is? Have you always felt that way?" [(Activity Guide: Listening Sessions, n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Skbt)
- "Be curious. When appropriate, ask questions to encourage the other person to elaborate on his or her thoughts and feelings." [(Shigeoka et al., n.d.)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/O2gh)
- "Think like an investigator. “Tell me more about that.” “How long have you felt this way?” “Is there something you’ve experienced personally that makes you think that way?”[(Represent.us, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/l1oN)
- “I want to understand \- can you tell me why that’s so important to you?” or “Is there a story behind this belief? I would really love to hear it?” [(Essential Partners, 2023\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Zfmw)
- “Instructing people to ask elaboration questions: "Such questions follow information another person has offered with a request to ‘‘please elaborate.” Examples include: ‘‘Could you tell me more about that?” and ‘‘Why do you think that?” “[(Chen et al., 2010\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/D1AL)

Pre-conversation text:

> In a few minutes, you and your partner will have a conversation about the following assigned topic. Based on your earlier answers, you and your partner see this issue differently.

> \<Topic\> **What you’ll do**

> Before joining the call, take a moment to practice a communication technique—**asking “tell-me-more” questions**—that you can use if you notice yourself reacting strongly to something your partner says.

> Even in good conversations, a comment can land the wrong way and make you want to jump in quickly to defend your view. A different strategy is to invite your partner to **say more about what they meant** before you respond.

> Use simple, open-ended invitations that ask your partner to expand or clarify what they have said. For example: \- “Can you tell me more about that?” \- “What does that mean to you?” \- “Can you walk me through an example?” \- “Say more.”

> **Why we’re asking you to do this**

> If something your partner says sparks a strong reaction, a brief “tell-me-more” question can give you a moment to think before responding.

> It also helps make sure you respond to what your partner actually meant, rather than react to a hasty assumption.

> **Practice:** Try writing “tell-me-more questions” to ask after each of the following statements: 1\. They say: “There is no excuse for putting pineapple on a pizza.” You say: \<response box\> 2\. They say: “Cyclists think traffic laws don’t apply to them.” You say: \<response box\> 3\. They say: “Kids these days have it too easy.” You say: \<response box\>

In-conversation text:

> Please have a conversation about the following topic: \<Topic\> Remember the strategy you learned of **asking “tell-me-more” questions**: \- Can you tell me more about that? \- What does that mean to you? \- Can you walk me through an example?

**Skill-Building: Looping for understanding**

Participants are trained to restate their partner’s message in their own words and ask whether they have understood it correctly. This conversational technique—sometimes called looping, or paraphrasing—helps ensure mutual understanding and demonstrates respect. These strategies have been shown to improve empathy, reduce defensiveness, and increase perceived listening quality [(Gottman et al., 1998\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/HNzF). In dialogue practice, “looping” reinforces attentive listening and signals that one is engaging in good faith before responding.

Operationalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

- "When things get heated, it’s easy to misunderstand what someone is really trying to say. There’s a technique to help with this – looping for understanding – that’s also a great way to show you’re listening. Here’s how it works: (1) listen closely to what the other person is saying, (2) rephrase it in your own words, (3) ask if you got it right. The reason why looping is so effective is because it makes you a better listener, and proves you want to connect. When we restate someone’s points in our own words, we often process it differently, which can bring new understanding. What's more by looping we demonstrate not just that we’ve heard their words, but that we’re trying to understand everything behind them. We're proving we're listening, which makes others more likely to listen in return." [(Duhigg, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/kZ5Z)
- "Make sure you understand the other’s view before you disagree with it. (“Let me see if I understand what you are saying....”)" [(Braver Angels, 2018b)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/KpCM)
- "reflection… is an effort to demonstrate to people that we see them as they wish to be seen. In a conversation, this may sound a bit like, “Let me see if I get it. For you it’s this and this and this. Did I get that right?” We’re aiming to show people we’ve heard them, to get to the point that they’d say: "Yes exactly, that’s it. That’s exactly me." [(Purple: America, We Need to Talk \- Film Discussion Guide, 2020\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/bqTF)
- "Restate the Other Person’s Argument to THEIR Satisfaction… You have to listen carefully enough to be able to restate the other person’s position without distortion. And without derogatory commentary.”[(Represent.us, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/l1oN)
- "Restate what you heard to clarify understanding, making sure to use "I" statements (“What I heard you say was” or “The way I understand your position is”). … When you use restatements to illustrate how you have understood the speaker, you allow them to either agree (“Yes, that is what I meant\!”) or to clarify their position (“Actually, what I meant was ...”). Importantly, restatements are not repetitions, meaning you should not merely repeat exactly what they said. Instead, put it in your own words, and signal that this is your understanding by starting your statement with “I.” [(Listen First Project, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/2HCJ)
- "Paraphrasing what the other says—to make sure that you understand and the other person feels heard… Don’t go farther than the person said by suggesting implications of their view… Be prepared to be corrected about what the person really meant, and look for “Yes, that’s what I’m saying.”[(Braver Angels, 2018a)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Zz2m)
- "Listen to understand, not to respond. Rephrase what the other person has said, and ask them if you’ve understood them correctly." [(Peacemakers Toolkit, 2023\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/Rx7T)
- “Try this: “Let me make sure I understand what you mean, you are saying that this is important to you because \_\_\_\_\_ and that you really wish\_\_\_\_\_\_. Is that right?” [(Herzig & Sarrouf, 2024\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/JP9y)
- "Acknowledge the opposing perspective. Rather than jumping in to your own argument, devote a few seconds to restating the other person’s position to demonstrate that you did indeed hear and understand it. [(Minson, 2023\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/ypUP)
- "Before expressing a disagreement, saying some version of “I hear you” (if you do)… Going back and forth between acknowledging the other’s feelings or viewpoint and then stating your own is generally more effective than just restating your position. It’s like a dance: two steps one way, one step back, and repeat. Aim for “yes, and” rather than “yes, but.” (I hear you, and here’s what I think about this.)"

> \<Topic\>

> **What you’ll do** Before joining the call, take a moment to practice a communication technique—called **looping for understanding**—that you can use to show your partner you hear them and take their ideas seriously, and to surface any misunderstandings.

> Looping has three steps:

> 1\. **Listen closely** to what your partner says. 2\. **Rephrase** it in your own words. 3\. **Ask** if you got it right. For example, if they say: _“It drives me crazy when people text while we’re hanging out. They say they’re listening, but it never feels that way. I miss when we actually paid attention to each other.”_

> You can say: \- “You value real connection, and when people are distracted, it feels like they don’t care — is that what you mean?”

> **Why we’re asking you to do this**

> Looping is a way to show that you’re listening and trying to understand, not just waiting for your turn to respond. It invites your partner to confirm or refine your understanding before you move on. **Practice:** Try “looping” the following statements using the three steps above. 1\. They say: _“My neighborhood has changed so much in the last few years, it feels like the sense of community is slipping away. People used to stop and talk, but now everyone just hurries past each other.”_ You say: \<response box\> 2\. They say: _“I put a lot of effort into my projects, and sometimes it feels like nobody notices unless something goes wrong._” You say: \<response box\>

In-conversation text:

> Please have a conversation about the following topic: \<Topic\> Remember to use the using the **looping for understanding** technique you learned: 1\. **Listen closely** to what your partner says. 2\. **Rephrase** it in your own words. 3\. **Ask** if you got it right.

**Skill-Building: Reframe to the positive**

Participants are trained to reframe their statements using **positive rather than negative language**. This means describing what _can_ be done or what _is valued_, rather than what should _not_ or _cannot_ be done. Positive framing may highlight shared goals, reduce defensiveness, and shift tone from opposition to possibility.

Operationalizations in the academic and practitioner literature:

- "Reframing to the positive. Avoid negative and contradictory words, such as “no,” “won’t” or “do not.” At the same time, increase your use of positive words to change the tone of the conversation." [(Minson, 2023\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/ypUP)
- "What are your hopes and aspirations for our country? Focus on the positives you hope for, rather than just the negatives you hope we avoid… "What’s good about your side? Why do you think your side’s values and policies are good for the country? Speak just about your own side and avoid comparisons that characterize the other side (“My side cares more about….”)"[(Braver Angels, 2021\)](https://paperpile.com/c/YjXQjD/cQq8)

Pre-conversation text:

> In a few minutes, you and your partner will have a conversation about the following assigned topic. Based on your earlier answers, you and your partner see this issue differently.

> \<Topic\> **What you’ll do**

> Before joining the call, take a moment to practice a communication technique—called **reframing to the positive**—that can be useful when you find yourself focusing on what you _don’t_ want, _can’t_ do, or want to move _away_ from.

> Positive framing flips the conversation to focus on what you value, what might be possible, and what you want to move toward.

> How to reframe a statement to the positive: 1\. Notice when your statement is framed around **what you _don’t_ want** (e.g., with words like _stop, can’t, shouldn’t_). 2\. Ask yourself **what value or outcome matters** to you underneath that concern. 3\. Rephrase your thought **around the positive value**.

> For example: \- “People shouldn’t interrupt.” → “Everyone should have a chance to finish their thought.” \- “That’ll never work.” → “There’s a key challenge we’d need to solve.” \- “Stop getting distracted.” → “Focus on what we’re doing.”

> **Why we’re asking you to do this** Positive framing highlights what is possible and worth moving toward without casting judgment on others. It helps shift conversations from opposition toward problem-solving. **Practice:** Try reframing the following statements to the positive: 1\. These kids are bouncing off the walls. \<response box\> 2\. You shouldn’t spend so much time on your phone. \<response box\>

> 3\. We’re not ready for this. \<response box\>

In-conversation text:

> Please have a conversation about the following topic: \<Topic\> Remember the strategy you learned of **reframing to the positive**: 1\. Notice when you’re talking about what you don’t want. 2\. Identify the value or outcome you want to support. 3\. Emphasize the positive version.
