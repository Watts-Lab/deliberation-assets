## Step 1: Please begin by discussing how people who share your view on this topic are sometimes **stereotyped or misunderstood**.

You might talk about:

- a stereotype, misconception, or exaggerated assumption you’ve heard
- what you wish people understood about you when they hear that stereotype

You may share what you wrote about earlier or anything else that feels relevant.

After you have completed this exercise, please move on to Step 2 below.
