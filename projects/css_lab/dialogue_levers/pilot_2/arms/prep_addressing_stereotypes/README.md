# Reflect and Share: Addressing Stereotypes

Participants are asked to reflect on common stereotypes or misperceptions about people who share their views and describe how they would want others to understand them more fully. The goal is to help participants see those who disagree as more complex than the caricature they are often presented with. These interventions may improve outgroup affect 45

## Operationalizations

- “...generate, discuss, and report back on the most common false stereotypes or misconceptions of their side, why these stereotypes are inaccurate, what is true instead, and whether there is a kernel of truth in the stereotype.” 46
- "Have you ever felt stereotyped by those who hold different views on this issue? If so, how? Which of these stereotypes was most painful to you? Most inaccurate? Why?" 22
- "What’s a common misconception or stereotype people on the outside have about you because of the groups (e.g., race, faith, or gender) you belong to? ... What’s something about you that challenges this stereotype?” 27
- "Please reflect for a moment on situations in which you have felt stereotyped by people who have different views or perspectives. Please make a list of 5-6 stereotypes, not worrying for the moment about how much truth (if any) there is in those stereotypes. As a \_**\_ I think that I am viewed by\_\_\_** as having these characteristics, beliefs or intentions:**\_\_\_**. Which one stereotype would you find to be most painful or offensive if someone applied it to you? Are there stereotypes on your list that you marked as particularly inaccurate that you’d like to speak about, again, indicating how you know yourself to be different from what these stereotypes would suggest about you?" 29
- "...correcting exaggerated stereotypes of out-partisans. This strategy is illustrated by correcting democracy misperceptions which presented participants with survey data correcting partisans’ inflated perceptions of levels of support for undemocratic practices among outpartisans.”45
- "Participants then engaged in a stereotype activity designed to illuminate stereotypes that are held by each group about the other group… This involved generating lists of stereotypes about one’s own group, labeling them as painful, inaccurate, or understandable, and then a facilitated dialogue about this activity." 47
