## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a few minutes to reflect on common assumptions people make about those who share your view, especially ones that feel oversimplified or exaggerated.

- What’s a common misunderstanding about people who hold your view?
- What do you wish someone who made that assumption understood about you—your values, intentions, or how you approach this issue?

Please **write your thoughts** in the box below.

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Reflecting on common assumptions helps surface misunderstandings that may come up in the conversation.

Sharing these reflections gives you a chance to describe how you think about this issue, rather than being seen only through a general label or category.

## What to expect

You will be invited to share these thoughts at the start of your conversation, and you can refer to your notes if you find it helpful.
