## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a few minutes to reflect on how people who share your view on this issue are sometimes stereotyped or misunderstood.

- What’s a common stereotype or misconception you’ve heard about people who hold your view?
- Does any part of it seem exaggerated, incomplete, or oversimplified?
- What do you wish someone understood about you—your values, intentions, or how you approach this issue—when they hear that stereotype?

Please **write your thoughts** in the box below.

## Why this helps

Reflecting on stereotypes you’ve encountered can help you enter the conversation with a clearer sense of what others sometimes get wrong about your perspective.

This can make it easier to explain who you are more fully—and to approach your partner with the same openness.

## What to expect

You will be invited to share these thoughts at the start of your conversation, and you can refer to your notes if you find it helpful.
