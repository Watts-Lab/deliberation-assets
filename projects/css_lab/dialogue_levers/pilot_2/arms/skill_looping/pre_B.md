## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a moment to practice a communication technique—called looping for understanding—that you can use to show your partner you hear them and take their ideas seriously, and to surface any misunderstandings.

Looping has three steps:

1. **Listen closely** to what your partner says.
2. **Rephrase** it in your own words.
3. **Ask** if you got it right.

For example, if they say:

> “It drives me crazy when people text while we’re hanging out. They say they’re listening, but it never feels that way. I miss when we actually paid attention to each other.”

You can say:

> “You value real connection, and when people are distracted, it feels like they don’t care — is that what you mean?”

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Looping is a way to show that you’re listening and trying to understand, not just waiting for your turn to respond.

It invites your partner to confirm or refine your understanding before you move on.

## Practice:

Try using "looping" the following statements using the three steps above.
