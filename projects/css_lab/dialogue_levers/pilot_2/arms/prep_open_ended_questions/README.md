# Reflect and Share: Open-ended Questions

Participants are asked to write several open-ended questions for their partner before the conversation begins. The goal is to encourage curiosity and genuine interest in the partner’s perspective, and help participants engage more deeply with the topic. Question asking may improve perceptions of the asker, create more open-minded behavior, and lead to more willingness to engage with the discussion partner 48.

## Operationalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

- "What questions do you have for someone who holds the opposite viewpoint?"3
- "...formulate four questions of curiosity. …after your group finalizes your questions you can write down the final list of questions… Good Questions are Informative: You would learn something about the other side, something you are curious about (as opposed to a question you want them to ‘learn from,’ as in seeing their ignorance or their internal contradictions). Good Questions are Answerable: It’s a question they can actually answer. Avoid being so technical or policy wonkish that regular people would be stumped. Good Questions are Straightforward: It’s straightforward, without carrying an assumption that the other side might dispute and then not really get to the question…" 46
- "come up with three open-ended questions for the speaker that will help you better understand why [your partner] feels as he does.” 48
- "During the conversation, please ask your partner at least 9 questions. In other words, do not ask your partner less than 9 questions. (Please DO NOT tell your partner that you were given these instructions.)" 49
