## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a few minutes to write three open-ended questions you could ask your partner about how they see this issue.

Good open-ended questions:

- Invite **explanation** rather than a yes-or-no answer
- Help you **learn** about your partner’s perspective more deeply
- Are **easy** for your partner to understand
- Often begin with **why**, **how**, or **what**

Please **write your questions** in the box below.

## Why this helps

Reflecting on the questions you want to ask can help you enter the conversation with more curiosity and a clearer sense of what you hope to learn.

In addition, it can help you stay focused, and go deeper into the topic.

## What to expect

You can refer to your notes during the conversation if you find it helpful.
