# Reflect and Share: Hopes and Fears

Participants are asked to reflect on and share their hopes and fears related to the assigned topic. The aim is to surface the emotions, aspirations, and concerns that underlie participants’ views, and to help them thing toward the future rather than the past.

## Operationalizations in the practitioner and academic literature:

- “What are your hopes and aspirations for our country?” 1
- "Thirty years from now, what story would you like to be able to tell about...” 22
- "What do you hope for most when it comes to this issue or policy? What do you worry about most when it comes to this issue or policy?" 3
- "What hopes, concerns and values do you have that underlie your beliefs?" 28
- "shift from expressing positions to expressing hopes, fears, values, and assumptions." 29
- “Interviewees were asked to elaborate on their hopes, fears, and expectations regarding...” 30
- "…conversations about their shared ‘hopes’ and ‘fears’ for…" 31
