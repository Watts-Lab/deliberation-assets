## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a few minutes to reflect on your **hopes and fears** about this issue. Think about what you most want to see happen — and what outcomes you hope to avoid.

Consider:

- What future you’d like to see
- What you worry about
- The aspirations or concerns that underlie your views

Please **write a few notes** in the box below about your hopes and fears.

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Writing about your hopes and fears can help you identify the feelings and emotions that shape your perspective - both positive and negative - and tie them to specific outcomes you care about.

## What to expect

You will be invited to share these thoughts during the conversation, and you can refer to your notes if you find it helpful.
