# Reflect and Share: Personal Storytelling

Participants are asked to reflect on and share personal stories that have shaped their beliefs about the discussion topic. The goal is to encourage narrative self-disclosure—participants are invited to explain the life experiences, challenges, relationships, or formative moments that have informed their perspective.

Academic research suggests that personal storytelling elicits more active listening and increases feelings of psychological safety in conversations 24, and leads to greater respect for contrasting opinions 10 and willingness to engage with disliked groups 11,25.

## Operationalizations in academic and practitioner literature:

- "What life experiences have influenced how you approach…" 26
- "Share something from your life experience that informs your response to or position on…" 2
- "What experiences have led you to believe what you believe about…" 3
- "What personal life experiences shaped the values that inform your current views or feelings about… Could you tell us something about one or two of these events or experiences" 22
- "Can you concretize that? Is there a specific example or a direct experience you’ve had that illustrates what you’re saying more concretely?” 12
- "Share a story from your life that shaped how you see…"22
- “How did you develop this belief?” or “Who impacted the way you see the world the most in your life?” These questions help them focus on the reasons behind their views, which builds more understanding and deeper relationships with those with whom we disagree." 27
- “talk about a meaningful event [you] have experienced…” 24
