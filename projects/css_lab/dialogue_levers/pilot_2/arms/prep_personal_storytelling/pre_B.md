## What you’ll do

Before joining the call, take a few minutes to think about the experiences that have influenced how you see this issue. Then choose **one story** that feels meaningful and **write about it in the box below**.

Your story might come from:

- a particular moment or event that shaped your view
- a time when your perspective shifted or evolved
- something you lived through
- an experience at home, school, work, or in your community
- something that affected someone close to you

## Why it helps

Reflecting on the experiences that shaped your views can help you enter the conversation feeling grounded and ready to share. Personal stories also make it easier for partners to listen openly and understand where your views come from.

## What to expect

We invite you to share this story during the conversation; you can refer to your notes if you find it helpful.
