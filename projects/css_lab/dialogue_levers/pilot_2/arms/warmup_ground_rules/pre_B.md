## What you’ll do

At the start of the conversation, you and your partner will come up with a few ground rules to guide how you want the discussion to go.

These might include agreements about:

- how to treat each other
- when to speak
- how to handle disagreement
- etc.

You’ll have a few minutes to decide these rules together before beginning the discussion.

## Why we’re asking you to do this

Creating ground rules together gives you and your partner a chance to decide how you want the conversation to go.

This is a chance to establish how you will behave and what you expect from one another.

## What to expect

At the beginning of the conversation, you’ll spend **3–4 minutes** agreeing on your ground rules together.

After that, you’ll move into a normal discussion of the topic.
