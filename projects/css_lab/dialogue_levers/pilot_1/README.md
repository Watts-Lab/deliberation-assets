# File Structure

-`intro/` contains files that are first used prior to the provision of any intervention, or conversation. (Some of these may be after assignment to condition, if they are generic to all conditions.) They may be reused in exit steps where we re-ask the same question. Putting them in the intro folder emphasizes that they are reused verbatim.

- `interventions/interventionX/` files for each intervention are sorted into subfolders within the interventions folder.

- `exit/` contains files that are used after the conversation

- `topics/` contains text of all the discussion topics used

# open questions

Should we ask people to list reasons for their belief, people who disagree's belief, or just arguments in favor or opposed to the policy?
