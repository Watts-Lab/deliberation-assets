The scheduling tool aims to streamline participant recruitment for balanced discussions by allowing individuals to sign up for specific time slots. In phase one of the experiment, participants were recruited by releasing studies 30 minutes before the discussions began. This method led to an imbalance, as more Democrats than Republicans were available on prolific platforms, making it difficult to assemble a politically diverse group.

The new scheduler addresses this challenge by guiding participants through initial steps, including audio-video checks and political affiliation identification, before asking them to select their availability from a set of weekly slots. Using this information, we will create study sessions that specifically invite a balanced number of Republicans and Democrats to participate. This approach ensures that the task’s invitees are prepared and politically balanced at the designated time.

The assumption underpinning this method is that the observed imbalance is due to a greater number of Democrats on prolific platforms, rather than individual Democrats being more active or responsive. If successful, the scheduler will mitigate delays in recruiting Republicans and avoid disproportionate representation during the discussions. However, the validity of the underlying assumption remains to be tested.

The scheduler will function as an individual task, with no simultaneous or interactive components. Participants will progress through only the intro sequence, culminating in a final stage where they receive a static screen displaying their completion code. This screen will lack a “continue” button, effectively marking the end of the task. Consequently, the scheduler will operate solely as an individual platform without incorporating game stages or exit stages typically used in collaborative or sequential tasks.
