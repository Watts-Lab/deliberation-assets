Each folder will always have files for:

- mid_A.md - text that goes before the topic during the conversation
- mid_B.md - text that goes after the topic during conversation

there will probably also be:

- pre_A.md - text that goes before the topic in the pre-conversation intervention
- pre_B.md - text that goes after the topic in the pre-conversation intervention

Plus comprehension checks as defined by the treatment.
