It can be tempting in conversations with people whom we disagree with to try and persuade our partner to adopt our point of view, or to score points by making the best argument.

Instead, in this conversation, we'd like you both to try only to **understand your partner's perspective** - what they believe about the topic, and why.

We will ask you at the beginning of your conversation to agree to **make this your goal** for the conversation.
