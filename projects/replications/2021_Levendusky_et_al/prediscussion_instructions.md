As mentioned, today’s study will take no more and likely less than 60 minutes. Also, note that, if you are willing, we will e-mail you in a week or two for a brief follow-up (of about three minutes). This is not required and you can certainly decline to provide your e-mail when we ask for it. If you do provide your email, and then complete the follow-up study we send you, we will enter you into a lottery to win an Amazon gift card. We will ask you to put your name on surveys simply so we can match two different surveys you complete, but it is entirely confidential and we will discard all names once data are entered.

Today’s study is on how people learn about political issues. First, you will be asked to fill out a brief preliminary questionnaire. Second, you be asked to complete an unrelated activity that takes only a few minutes. Third, we will ask you to read a brief newspaper article, and then ask you to discuss it in a small group. We will describe how this works specifically at the time. Fourth, you will be asked to fill out another brief questionnaire. Finally, we will pay you, and you can leave.
