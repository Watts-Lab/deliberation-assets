# Modifications

### 1.

In the original study, participants were grouped into high, medium, and low prejudice groups based on their answers to a 100-item Multifactor Racial Attitude Inventory (MRAI) that was administered several weeks prior to the study. (This gave the researchers time to score the questionnaires and compose groups.) Immediately prior to the discussion, participants completed an 8-item racial attitude survey that was correlated with the MRAI in both pilot tests and in the actual study data. Because our modification is computer-mediated, we can use the 8-item scale directly to assign participants to groups. This seems to have been closer to the original goal of the research, as they wanted groups to be composed of individuals who expressed varying levels of opinions on this 8-question battery. In addition, it significantly decreases participant effort and the need for a two-phase design.

### 2.

In the original study, questions about racial attitudes were designed to capture dimensions of racial tension characteristic of the times. While the general subject material remains unchanged, it is appropriate to adapt these questions to the relevant dimensions of racial tension today.

#### Reported in Myers and Bishop 1970

- "Some people recently have been saying that 'white racism' is basically responsible for conditions in which Negroes live in American cities. Others Disagree. How do you feel?"
- "Other items were concerned with such matters as federal versus local control of school desegregation"
- "property rights vs open housing"
- "two-way school bussing to achieve integration"
- "boycotting of a discriminatory business
- "patience vs activism as an effective black strategy"

#### New items

- Affirmative action?
- Black lives matter?
- Police racism?

### 3.

The original study used groups of 4-7 members. No rationale is given, but is presumably because participants were recruited in a classroom setting from an existing population, and even groups could not be constructed. In this replication, we use groups of 5.

### 4.

The authors of the original study do not report the discussion materials for the control groups. They say "COntrol subjects discussed irrelevant materials (two-choice dilemma problems). One risky and one cautious item were used. Significant risky and cautious shifts, previously observed on these items with college subjects, occurred also in the high-school population.

At one point, the authors refer to another study they are working on, which is most likely "Myers, David G., and Sidney J. Arenson. 1972. “Enhancement of Dominant Risk Tendencies in Group Discussion.” Psychological Reports 30 (2): 615–23.", although they don't give a full citation. In this second paper, they say that the choice questions used came from Kogan and Wallach 1964. We may never know what this is, because it isn't online.
