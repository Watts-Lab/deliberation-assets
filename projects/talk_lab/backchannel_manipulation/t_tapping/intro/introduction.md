## 🗣️ About this study

This is a study about **storytelling**.  
You’ll be randomly assigned to either **tell a story** or **listen to someone telling a story**.

Take a moment to think of a story you might tell **if you’re chosen as the storyteller**.

## If you are chosen as the storyteller:

- We’d like you to tell a story about a close call or near-miss incident — a time when something almost went wrong, but everything turned out okay in the end.
- If you can't think of a story about yourself, you can tell someone else's story.
- The story should be 1-2 minutes long.

When you’ve thought of a story, **click the button below** to continue.

If you are the storyteller, you will have a few more minutes to prepare and a chance to practice telling it.
