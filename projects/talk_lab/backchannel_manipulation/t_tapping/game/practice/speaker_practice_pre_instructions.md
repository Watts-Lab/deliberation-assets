## 🎙️ You are the **storyteller**

In this study, you’ll tell **the same story** to **two different people**, one at a time.

Before you begin, you’ll do a short **practice round** where you tell your story to an empty room.

At the end of the study you will tell your story a final time to just the camera.

### 💭 If you don’t have a story yet

Take a moment to think of one now.

The story should be a close call or near-miss incident — a time when something almost went wrong, but everything turned out okay in the end.

You can pick any story you like, but here are a few ideas to help you get started:

- A **close call** when something almost went very wrong
- A **bad travel experience** — what went wrong?
- A story about bad **weather** or the **outdoors**.
- The craziest thing you ever saw while **driving**.
- A **near injury** — what were you doing and what happened next?

If you can't think of a story about yourself, you can tell someone else's story.

Tell your story in as much detail as you can, not just a few sentences. Describe what happened, what you were thinking or feeling, and how it turned out.

👉 Remember, the story should be 1-2 minutes long.
