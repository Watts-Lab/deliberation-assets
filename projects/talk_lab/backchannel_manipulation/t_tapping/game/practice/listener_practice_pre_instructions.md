## 🦻 You are the **listener**

In this study, you will listen to **two different people** tell a story, one at a time.

We'd like you to listen in two different ways:

- For one story, just **listen normally**.
- For the other story, **listen for words that start with the letter 'T'**.

We'll tell you which type of listening to use before each story.

### Normal listening

For this story, listen **the way you normally would in everyday conversation**.

- Focus on what the person is saying.
- Respond naturally (e.g., “mm-hmm,” nodding, facial reactions).

### Listening for words that start with 'T'

For this story, **listen for words that start with the letter 'T'**.

- Listen carefully to the speaker’s words.
- Each time you hear a word that starts with T, **type the letter “t” in the box** on your screen.

You’ll be keeping a running count, like:

> t t t t t t t …

It’s okay if you miss a few, but please try to catch as many as you can.

### What to expect

- Before each story, we will tell you which type of listening to use.
- During the story, you will see a reminder on the screen.

### 👉 Please don't tell your partner about these instructions. 👈

Please leave your webcam and mic enabled.
