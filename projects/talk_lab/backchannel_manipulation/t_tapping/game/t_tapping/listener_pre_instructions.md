You are about to listen to someone tell a story.

## For this story, **listen for words that start with the letter 'T'**.

- Listen carefully to the speaker’s words.
- Each time you hear a word that starts with T, **type the letter “t” in the box** on your screen.

You’ll be keeping a running count, like:

> t t t t t t t …

It’s okay if you miss a few, but please try to catch as many as you can.

### 👉 Please don't tell your partner about these instructions. 👈
