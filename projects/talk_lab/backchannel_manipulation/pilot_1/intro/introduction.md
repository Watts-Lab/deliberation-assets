## üó£Ô∏è About this study

This is a study about **storytelling**.  
You‚Äôll be randomly assigned to either **tell a story** or **listen to one**.

## üí≠ Before we begin

Take a moment to think of a story you might tell **if you‚Äôre chosen as the storyteller**.

We‚Äôd like you to tell a story about a close call or near-miss incident ‚Äî a time when something almost went wrong or someone was almost hurt, but everything turned out okay in the end.

Please choose a story you feel comfortable sharing. If you can‚Äôt think of something that happened to you, you can tell a close-call story that happened to someone you know.

Tell your story in as much detail as you can, not just a few sentences. Describe what happened, what you were thinking or feeling, and how it turned out. Aim for about 1-2 minutes in length

Here are a few ideas to help you think of a story:

- A **close call** when something almost went very wrong
- A **bad travel experience** ‚Äî what went wrong?
- A story about bad **weather**, the **ocean**, or the **outdoors**
- The craziest thing you ever saw while **driving**
- A **near injury** ‚Äî what were you doing and what happened next?

You can use one of these prompts or **tell any other story** that fits the general description. If you can‚Äôt think of a story about yourself, you can tell one you‚Äôve **heard recently**.

Remember, the story should be 1-2 minutes long.

When you‚Äôve thought of a story, **click the button below** to continue.
