## 🗣️ About this study

This is a study about **storytelling**.  
You’ll be randomly assigned to either **tell a story** or **listen to one**.

## 💭 Before we begin

Take a moment to think of a story you might tell **if you’re chosen as the storyteller**.

We’d like you to tell a story about a close call or near-miss incident — a time when something almost went wrong or someone was almost hurt, but everything turned out okay in the end.

Please choose a story you feel comfortable sharing. If you can’t think of something that happened to you, you can tell a close-call story that happened to someone you know.

If you are the storyteller, you will tell your story in as much detail as you can, not just a few sentences. Describe what happened, what you were thinking or feeling, and how it turned out.

Here are a few ideas to help you think of a story:

- A **close call** when something almost went very wrong
- A **bad travel experience** — what went wrong?
- A story about bad **weather**, the **ocean**, or the **outdoors**
- The craziest thing you ever saw while **driving**
- A **near injury** — what were you doing and what happened next?

You can use one of these prompts or **tell any other story** that fits the general description. If you can’t think of a story about yourself, you can tell one you’ve **heard recently**.

Remember, the story should be 1-2 minutes long.
