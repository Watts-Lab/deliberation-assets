**Reminder:** During this round, we want you to try to count all the words that begin with "t" in the speaker's story.

For example, if your partner starts their story, "Once upon a time, there was a..." you would count the two words that began with "t's" (i.e., time, there). Your primary goal is to make sure that your count is accurate, but otherwise, listen and act naturally.

When the speaker has finished, click the button below to continue to the next stage.
