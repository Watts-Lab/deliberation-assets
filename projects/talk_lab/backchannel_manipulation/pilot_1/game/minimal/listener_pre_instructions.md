You are about to listen to someone tell a story.

**Reminder:** During this round, we want you to show _REDUCED_ backchannel behavior.

Keep your reactions minimal while still appearing attentive. You can occasionally nod or give a short “mm-hm” or “yeah,” but limit both verbal and nonverbal responses and avoid strong emotional reactions.
