## 🦻 You are the **listener**

In this study, you will listen to **three different people** tell a story, one at a time.

For each story, we want you to **change how you listen**.

### Listening is active

You may not be fully conscious of it, but while you listen to a story, you are also communicating to the storyteller. You naturally give little signals like:

- saying "mm-hmm", "yeah", "right", etc.
- nodding
- showing surprise or empathy through facial expressions

### Your role in this study

We want to understand how these signals influence the speaker - so we need you to change how expressive you are in your listening behavior.

Before each story, we'll give you one of the following sets of instructions:

#### Increase Responsiveness

- Listen more actively and expressively.

#### Decrease Responsiveness

- Keep your responses more minimal.

#### Normal Responsiveness

- Listen as you naturally would.

### What to expect

Before each story, we'll tell you which of these three listening goals we'd like you to have for the upcoming call.

You will also see a brief reminder during the call.

### 👉 Please don't tell your partner about these instructions. 👈

Please leave your webcam and mic enabled.
