## 🦻 You are the **listener**

In this study, you will listen to **three different people** tell a story, one at a time.

For each story, we want you to **change how you listen**.

### Listening behavior

You may not realize it, but while you listen to a story, you are also communicating to the storyteller. You naturally give little signals like:

- saying "mm-hmm", "yeah", "right", etc.
- nodding
- showing surprise or empathy through facial expressions

### Your role in this study

We want to understand how these signals influence the speaker - so we need you to change the how expressive you are in your listening behavior.

Before each story, we'll give you one of the following sets of instructions:

# Background

In everyday conversation, people are always doing two things at once: 🗣️ one person is usually speaking, but the other person—the listener 👂—is also communicating, often in small but important ways.

These listener responses are called "backchannels"—things like nodding, smiling, saying “mm-hm,” “yeah,” “right,” or showing surprise or empathy through facial expressions. Even though they’re brief and often automatic, backchannels are a crucial part of how conversations flow and how people feel heard.

## What this study tests:

In this study, we’re exploring how these listener signals affect the way stories are told.

To do this, you’ll listen to three different people tell short stories, one at a time, in random order.

## Your role:

For each story, you’ll receive a short on-screen reminder describing how we’d like you to respond while listening.

Across the three rounds (in random order), you’ll be asked to:

1. NATURAL RESPONSES: Listen as you naturally would.

2. INCREASE RESPONSES: Listen more actively and expressively.

3. MINIMAL RESPONSES: Keep your responses more minimal.

You’ll always remain the listener, but your role is active: we need you to vary your backchannel behavior to help us understand how listener feedback influences storytelling.

Please follow the reminder shown at the start of each round, listen carefully, and react in line with those instructions.

### 👉 Do not let the speaker know you have been given these instructions. 👈
