## 🎙️ You are the **storyteller**

In this study, you’ll tell **the same story** to **three different people**, one at a time.

Before you begin, you’ll do a short **practice round** where you tell your story to an empty room.

At the end of the study you will tell your story a final time to just the camera.

### 💭 If you don’t have a story yet

Take a moment to think of one now.

Remember the story should be a close call or near-miss incident — a time when something almost went wrong or someone was almost hurt, but everything turned out okay in the end.

Here are a few ideas to help you think of a story:

- A **close call** when something almost went very wrong
- A **bad travel experience** — what went wrong?
- A story about bad **weather**, the **ocean**, or the **outdoors**
- The craziest thing you ever saw while **driving**
- A **near injury** — what were you doing and what happened next?

If you can't think of a story about yourself:

- Tell any other story that fits the general description
- Tell a story you have heard recently

Remember, the story should be 1-2 minutes long.
