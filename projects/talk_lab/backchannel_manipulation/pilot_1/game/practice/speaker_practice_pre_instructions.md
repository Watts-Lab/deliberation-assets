## 🎙️ You are the **storyteller**

In this study, you’ll tell **the same story** to **three different people**, one at a time.

Before you begin, you’ll do a short **practice round** where you tell your story to an empty room.

### 💭 If you don’t have a story yet

Take a moment to think of one now.  
It can be funny, surprising, or serious — anything that makes a good story.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- A **bad travel experience** — what went wrong?
- A time you had a **close call**, when something _almost_ went very wrong
- A time you had to **admit a mistake**
- The **craziest thing** you ever saw while driving
- A time you **broke a bone** — what were you doing?

You can use one of these prompts or tell **any other story** you like.  
If you can’t think of one about yourself, it’s okay to tell a story you’ve **heard recently**.

When you’ve thought of a story, **click the button below** to continue.
