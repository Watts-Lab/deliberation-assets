You are about to listen to someone tell a story.

**Reminder:** During this round, we want you to show _INCREASED_ backchannel behavior.

Listen in an especially expressive and responsive way. While your partner tells their story, use frequent—but natural—nods, facial expressions, short verbal acknowledgments such as “mm-hm,” and “yeah,” and appropriate emotional responses. Stay engaged and encouraging without interrupting.
