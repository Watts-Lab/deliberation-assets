You are about to listen to someone tell a story.

# Listen with **Increased** Responsiveness

Show you are extra **engaged** and **interested** in the story, without being unnatural.

## ✅ You should:

- Nod and smile often
- Use "mm-hmm", "Yeah!", "Wow!", "OMG!", "Right!?!"
- React to the storyteller and show how you feel

### 👉 Please don't tell your partner about these instructions. 👈
