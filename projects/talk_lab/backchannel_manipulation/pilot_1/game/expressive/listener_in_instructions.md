**Reminder:** During this round, we want you to show _INCREASED_ backchannel behavior.

Listen in an especially expressive and responsive way. While your partner tells their story, use frequent—but natural—nods, facial expressions, short verbal acknowledgments such as “mm-hm,” and “yeah,” and appropriate emotional responses. Stay engaged and encouraging without interrupting.

When the speaker has finished, click the button below to continue to the next stage.
