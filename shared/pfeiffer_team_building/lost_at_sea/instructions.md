Following is a list of 15 items that are intact and undamaged after the ﬁre. In addition to these articles, you have a serviceable, rubber life raft with oars. The raft is large enough to carry yourself, the crew, and all the items in the following list. The total contents of all survivors’ pockets are a package of cigarettes, several books of matches, and ﬁve one-dollar bills.

Your task is to rank the 15 items that follow in terms of their importance to your survival. Place the number 1 by the most important item, the number 2 by the second most important, and so on through number 15, the least important.
