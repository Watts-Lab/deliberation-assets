# Context for the exercise

You are adrift on a private yacht in the South Pacific. As a consequence of a ﬁre of unknown origin, much of the yacht and its contents have been destroyed. The yacht is now slowly sinking. Your location is unclear because of the destruction of critical navigational equipment and because you and the crew were distracted trying to bring the ﬁre under control. Your best estimate is that you are approximately one thousand miles south-southwest of the nearest land.
