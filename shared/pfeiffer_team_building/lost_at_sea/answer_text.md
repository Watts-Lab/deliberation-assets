# Answer Rationale:

According to the experts, the basic supplies needed when a person is stranded in mid-ocean are articles to attract attention and articles to aid survival until rescuers arrive. Articles for navigation are of little importance: Even if a small life raft were capable of reaching land, it would be impossible to store enough food and water to subsist during that period of time. Therefore, of primary importance are the shaving mirror and the two- gallon can of oil-gas mixture. These items could be used for signaling air- sea rescue. Of secondary importance are items such as water and food, e.g., the case of Army C rations.
