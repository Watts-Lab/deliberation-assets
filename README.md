## Production Usage

This repo is synced to a CDN, but also provides version control for files, so that
we can refer to the precise version of a file when tracing the data.

During dev, you can start this as a local webserver by running:

```bash
npx http-server --cors -a localhost -p 9090

```

or:

```bash
npx serve -l 9090 --cors
```

In the deliberation-empirica admin, specify the cdn as:
